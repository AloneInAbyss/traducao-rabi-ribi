10000
......
...?
Uaah... Eu dormi por muito tempo...
Por que a Mestra não me acordou?
...?
Espere... Por que o chão está tão duro?@E tem alguma coisa em cima de mim.

10001
Qu-Que lugar é esse?@Eu não estava dormindo perto da Mestra e da Miru?
Por que eu estou aqui? Esta é outra das brincadeiras da Miru?
Mestra... Miru... Onde vocês estão?
......
A-Algo está errado.@Mestra... Estou aqui! Erina está aqui!
...!
Eu posso falar!@Sou uma coelha falante!
......
Falante?
Quê...?@Estou falando mesmo?!@Pensei que eu estava apenas imaginando coisas!
O que está acontecendo?!@Coelhas não podem falar!

10002
...!
Isso... O qu-que é isso?!@Eu... Eu sou humana?!
Como isso aconteceu? Não pode ser verdade!
...Minhas orelhas de coelha e minha cauda...
...ainda estão aqui.@Então o que eu sou?
Um coelho se transformando em humano...
......
É impossível. Eu devo estar sonhando...
Mas tudo parece tão real... O que está acontecendo?

10003
Corpo, pare... pare de tremer.@Eu sei que você está assustado.
Eu...@Queria que a Mestra estivesse aqui.@Ela sempre vinha me confortar...
Mestra... Onde você está...?@O que aconteceu comigo...?
Espere! Não importa onde ela está...
Onde EU estou?
E o que aconteceu comigo?
Pare de se sentir assustada... Se não estou sonhando...@Eu não acho que ficar aqui vai resolver alguma coisa.

10004
Ah, ficar em pé é difícil...@Isso não é cansativo?
......
Acho que aquilo é um espelho.@A Mestra tinha algo parecido em sua casa também.
......
Então eu sou desse jeito... Cabelo roxo...@Não que eu goste disso, mas... Acho que parece ok.@Fofo, talvez?
Haha, uma coelha obcecada pela aparência... @A Mestra caçoava bastante de mim por causa disso...
......
Mestra... Vou te encontrar.

10010
Erina...? É você, Erina?

10011
Essa voz... É a Miru!
Miru está aqui também?
Mas a voz dela parecia um pouco diferente.
Miru geralmente parece tão cansada...

10020
Acordada finalmente, pequena coelha?
É hora de você retornar por enquanto. Venha até aqui.

10021
...?
Uma voz diferente...@Que eu não reconheço... 

10031
A voz pareceu vir do andar de cima.@Eu devo seguir um caminho diferente...

12001
Erina... você finalmente está aqui?

12003
......
É você, Miru?@É sim! Você está aqui também!
......
O que foi?@Você não parece estar muito bem...
Espere aqui mesmo pequena coelha!@Isto é o mais longe que você vai chegar.
M-Miru...? D-do que você está falando?
Temos que ir.@Eu vou cuidar dessa garota por enquanto!
Por que você está falando isso?@ E Miru, o que é isso no seu...?

12004
Sem mais perguntas.@Você ainda tem muito o que fazer quando voltar.

//OPENING (FOREST)
12100
......
Eu sei que todo mundo ama coelhos,@mas fazer uma pausa é importante também.
Parece que ela estava exausta,@então um bom descanso deve resolver as coisas...
Ai...
Há tantas de vocês que estou com dificuldade@de acompanhar. Mas essa garota... @Eu realmente não tenho nenhuma impressão dela.
E...
......
...Hmm?

12101
Espera aí...
Isso... Isso é...?
Será que essa garota...
O qu-qu-que eu devo fazer?@Isso é totalmente inesperado!@Meu coração não está pronto para isso!
Mas isso está mesmo certo...?@Eu...
Se eu apenas...

12008
D-d-desculpa! Mil desculpas!@Eu te assustei?@F-foi um acidente!
Hmm? Não, na verdade...
......
Estranho... Que lugar é esse?
O que aconteceu com o lugar estranho e a Miru?@Isso foi mesmo um sonho?
Não! Eu ainda consigo falar...@e eu ainda pareço humana.
Ei, você está se sentindo melhor agora?@Eh... você vai pegar um resfriado se dormir aqui fora.
...?
Desculpa... Eu estava pensando alto e não@percebi você.
Você estava cuidando de mim?@Como eu posso ter dormido aqui?
E-eu acho que sim. Não aconteceu nada!@Eu estava apenas esperando você acordar.
Sério? Que gentileza a sua!@Sou tão sortuda em conhecer alguém@tão bondosa quanto a Mestra!
N-não sorria para mim desse jeito...
...Se você ficar me olhando assim, eu...
......
D-desculpa... Eu realmente preciso ir agora.@Talvez nos veremos de novo...
Ei... por que você está indo?@Eu... mas...

5000
Espere! Você aí, com as orelhas de coelho!@Você não pode passar daqui!
Esta praia está fechada por enquanto, então está inacessível!
S-Sério?@Me desculpe...
Com licença, mas... @A casa da Mestra Rumi é por aqui?
Mestra Rumi? Você quer dizer a Rumi de Rabi Rabi Town?@Claro. É por aqui, atravessando a praia,@e então depois de uma pequena ravina.
Este caminho está fechado por enquanto então@você pode esperar um pouquinho?@Enquanto isso você pode continuar@procurando pelos coelhos.
Procurar por coelhos?
Obrigada, de qualquer maneira.@Eu vou esperar então.

5001
Então tudo o que posso fazer é esperar aqui.
......
Esse lugar parece familiar.
É aqui que eu fui adotada pela Mestra?
Acho que posso dar uma volta por aqui,@e testar essa forma humana!

12010
Eu ainda não agradeci aquela garota.@Por que ela está com pressa?
......
Espera! Eu acho que ela é uma das amigas da Mestra.@Ela costumava vir e brincar comigo.@Eu não tinha percebido!
Não me importa esse corpo por enquanto...@Se eu segui-la, eu posso conseguir encontrar a Mestra.

//FIRST SAVE POINT
19
......
É esse o lugar!@Esse é meu antigo lar!
Nunca imaginei que voltaria aqui.@Isso foi há muito tempo.
Wow!@Minha pilha de grama ainda está ali!@Parece tão macia agora!
Mas este corpo não vai caber ali mais. Que pena...
......
Eu acho que conheço tudo naquela direção.@Será que alguma coisa mudou?

//VS COCOA1
55
Por que tem tantos cogumelos vermelhos por aqui?@Eu não precisava ter passado por todo esse caminho...
Mas esses são grandes o suficiente, então valeu a pena!@Com tantos para pegar pela floresta,@por que as pessoas compram eles?

56
Oh! Maravilha!@Encontrei a Sra. Gato!
Sra. Gato... Ela parece familiar...@Poderia ela ser amiga da Mestra também?

57
Ahh! Quem está aí?@Não assuste as pessoas desse jeito!!@Essas criaturas da floresta estão chegando até mim...
Ei, Sra. Gato, nem todos os cogumelos são bons.@Esses vermelhos brilhantes podem ser venenosos.
Eu sei disso!@Não me subestime, quem quer que seja você!@Eu sou uma especialista nisso!
Provavelmente porque nós somos muito pobres...@e precisamos procurar em qualquer lugar por comida...
Sra. Gato? Pobre?@Você deve ser uma amiga da Mestra então! Eu sei disso!
Mestra? Eu nunca te vi antes.@Quem é você?
Espere... Orelhas de coelho?!
Você deve ser uma daquelas amantes de coelhos.@Com todas essas pessoas vestindo orelhas de coelho,@Eu devia ter ignorado elas.
Eu não entendo, Sra. Gato...
Eu sei que pareço assim agora...@mas eu sou a coelha da Mestra Rumi!@Eu esperava que Sra. Gato pudesse me levar até a Mestra!
Pra trás, estranha! Eu posso ser pobre,@mas eu nunca vou me juntar ao seu grupo de loucos!
E usando a coelha perdida da Rumi como desculpa...@Essa é a terceira vez que vocês tentaram esse truque!
Espere... Você deve estar se confundindo! Eu realmente so--
Ei! O que você pensa que está fazendo?@Eu disse pra se afastar!
Por que todas vocês são desse jeito?@Fique aí... senão!
E-Espere, Sra. Gato?!@O que você está fazendo?

900
Ai! S-Sem violência!@Quem ataca as pessoas com um martelo?!
Eu não vou ser derrotada!@Não vou perder para o seu tipo!
Ei, Sra. Gato...@Você poderia só parar e me escutar...?
Não, eu não vou! Eu odeio esses estranhos@amantes de coelhos!

901
Não... Não vá! Sra. Gato!
......
Aff... O que está acontecendo...@estranhos amantes de coelhos...? Mas EU SOU uma coelha...
Talvez eu achei a pessoa errada.@Eu não entendi do que ela estava falando...
E eu achei que ela poderia me ajudar...@ Acho que eu deveria voltar agora antes que eu vá muito longe.

8
Eu ouço passos à frente...@É a Sra. Gato ou...?

//FOLLOW COCOA AT WARP STONE
3500
Isso é péssimo!@Se esses estranhos continuarem aparecendo,@Rabi Rabi Town estará amaldiçoada!
Tenho sorte de ter fugido... e com os cogumelos também,@ou eu teria que pedir pra Rumi para jantar de novo...
A Rumi diz que ela não se importa... mas é constrangedor!
......
É melhor eu teleportar para Rabi Rabi enquanto eu posso.

3501
Ah...? Ela sumiu?@Sra. Gato desapareceu!
Eu achei que poderia segui-la até em casa...
......
Sra. Gato disse algo sobre teleportar para a cidade.@Ela estava falando disso?
Nesse caso,@talvez eu posso voltar para a Mestra por aqui!

3503
Isso... Isso funcionou?@Eu fui teleportada pra outro lugar!
......
Onde eu estou?@Acho que fiz algo errado...
......
Mas devo dizer, esse lugar é lindo!
Ser humana talvez não seja tão ruim afinal...@Eu sempre quis conhecer o mundo!

//VS RIBBON
450
Aii! Que... No que eu bati?
...?
Wow! Que coelho grande!!
Fique longe... R-Ribbon não tem um gosto bom!
Desculpa, Sra. Fada...@Eu não estava prestando atenção...@Você se machucou?
Ele falou!@Ribbon nunca ouviu falar de um coelho falante!
N-não chegue mais perto!@Fadas podem ser pequenas, mas não m-mexa com a gente!@Ribbon não está assustada!

70
...Então é assim? A fofa Ribbon vai ser@comida por um coelho gigante...@E Ribbon pensou que teria uma longa vida à frente...
Lilli, Pixie... Me perdoe.@Por favor não pensem que Ribbon abandonou vocês...
Pare de falar sozinha!@Eu não vou te comer!@Eu só estava de passagem.

71
Ela me pegou! Ribbon vai ser devorada! Ahh...

72
...?
Tão fofinha e pequena!@Fadas costumavam ser do meu tamanho!
Oii, Sra. Fada! Sou Erina.@Prazer em te conhecer!
Uma humana? Oi...@Obrigada por salvar Ribbon...
Onde o coelho gigante foi?@Ribbon quase morreu de susto...
Umm... Eu era esse coelho.@Porém, carne é ruim para coelhos!
Mas...
Tinha um coelho gigante... e ele era você...@Ribbon estava alucinando?

73
Então você é uma coelha procurando por sua Mestra.@Tem algo diferente em você...@você ainda parece humana!
Isso é... tão estranho assim?@Eu não sei como me tornei humana...
Eu estava desse jeito quando acordei.@Ainda parece como um sonho...
Wow... Ribbon nunca ouviu falar de algo parecido...@Mas por que você está aqui? Está perdida?
Não era pra eu ter vindo aqui embaixo,@mas eu comecei a andar por aqui porque estava curiosa.@Eu devia estar em Rabi Rabi Town...
Rabi... Rabi Town?
Sim, é onde eu vivo com a Mestra.@O que foi? Você parece preocupada, Ribbon.
N-Nada.@Ribbon não está preocupada.
Então por que você está aqui, Ribbon?@Você parecia muito perturbada quando nós batemos@uma na outra.
Perturbada, huh...?
Oh... Sim!@Ribbon escapou mas Lilli e Pixie ainda estão@presas lá dentro!
Escapou? O que houve com você?@E... Lilli? Pixie?
Lilli e Pixie são amigas da Ribbon...@Nós estávamos explorando quando uma garota loira nos pegou.
Ribbon se sentiu atordoada lá...@Talvez por isso Erina pareceu um coelho gigante.
Erina poderia ajudar a resgatá-las?@Ribbon não vai ficar com medo de ser pega@se você estiver lá!
É claro que posso te ajudar!@Elas estão ali na frente?
Maravilha! Obrigada, Erina!@Elas estão nesse caminho. Apenas continue indo para frente!

//TRY TO JUMP TO CICINI ROOM
180
É um caminho sem saída?
Não é. Olhe ali em cima!
Mas parece... meio alto.@Vou tentar pular.

181
Umm... @É muito alto para mim...
Hmmm, o que devemos fazer?
Nós não podemos deixar elas esperando.@Tem algum outro caminho?
Hmm, nesse caso...@Ribbon pode ir com você para Rabi Rabi Town primeiro.@Nós poderíamos encontrar alguém que possa nos ajudar!
Tem certeza?@Enquanto suas amigas estão presas aqui...
Ribbon sabe, mas não podemos só ficar aqui.@Você está procurando por um caminho para casa, certo?
Mas Rabi Rabi Town pode estar bem longe.@Tem pessoas na floresta que possam ajudar?
Uh, bem... podemos pedir ajuda na floresta...@mas só se não tiver outra escolha.@Ribbon não quer que outras pessoas saibam que ela saiu...
Um segredo!@Você quer que eu mantenha segredo da Mestra também?
Não, tudo bem!@Ribbon na verdade está interessada na sua Mestra!
Então Ribbon quer conhecer minha Mestra também?@Você parece ansiosa!
Eu... não é isso!@Nós devíamos ir.@Temos que voltar depois!
Ok, vamos lá!

//TALK ABOUT WARP STONE
5500
Erina! Olhe! É uma Warp Stone!
Warp Stone?
Essa coisa flutuante se chama Warp Stone?@Que nome chato!@Eu estava imaginando qual era o nome disso.
Imaginando, huh?@Ribbon imagina que você estava curiosa, chegou muito perto,@e acabou vindo aqui, certo?
Não...@Eu cheguei perto porque a Sra. gato disse@que isso leva pra Rabi Rabi!
É impossível.@Warp Stones apenas funcionam para lugares que você já esteve.
Você ainda não foi pra nenhum lugar,@então foi mandada para a Warp Stone mais próxima.
Então foi isso que aconteceu... @Podemos usar isso para voltar para a floresta agora?
Sim.@Chegue mais perto e pense no lugar que você quer ir!
Aliás, já que Ribbon vai junto com você,@nós só podemos teleportar para lugares que nós duas já estivemos.

453
Funcionou, voltamos para a floresta!@Você é incrível Ribbon!
Isso é conhecimento geral da ilha,@então não é tão incrível...
Então por qual caminho vamos agora, Erina?
Nós devemos voltar pra onde eu acordei.@Por aqui, me siga!

//NO ENTRY
5200
O caminho aqui em cima não parece familiar.@Melhor não ir muito longe...

5201
Espera Erina!@Esse não é o caminho para Rabi Rabi Town!
Oh... Verdade.@Eu fiquei curiosa e continuei andando.

5202
Erina, você não disse para irmos por ali?@Por que você está indo pelo outro caminho?
Desculpa...@Eu só queria checar uma coisa...

300
Espere! Isso nos leva pra longe.@Ribbon acha que é melhor não irmos por aí.

139
Espere! Não vá mais longe!@Ribbon não acha que devemos ir por aqui.
Umm sim, Eu me sinto assim também.@Sinto como se meu corpo não quisesse@continuar.
Que estranho...@Vamos sair daqui!

138
A biblioteca ainda não abriu.@Nenhuma entrada autorizada!

//VS UPRPRC1
58
Não, me escutem! Eu realmente vi um coelho aqui!
Okay, okay... Você disse isso centenas de vezes,@mas ela devia ser uma de nós!@Se ela parecia humana, ela não pode ser um coelho...
Isso significa que seu amor por coelhos não é forte o suficiente!@Eu soube na hora que ela era um coelho especial!
Não importa...

68
Ribbon! Ribbon!@O que está acontecendo? Aquelas são orelhas de coelho!@Eu acho que encontrei a minha espécie!
Orelhas de coelho? Não.@Aquelas duas são apenas garotas com orelhas falsas.
Ah não! Essa não!@Ribbon esqueceu!
Esqueceu...?

59
...!
É-É um coelho! É realmente um coelho!@Seus instintos estavam certos!
Eu te disse! Mas eu não vou te culpar.@Entretanto, esse coelho...@Depois de todos esses meses, um coelho finalmente apareceu!
É um coelho em forma de humano também...@I-Isso é o paraíso?
Eww... Ribbon não gosta daquele olhar em seus rostos...
Ribbon, o que está acontecendo com as garotas coelho?@Algo parece estranho...
Elas não são coelhos!@Ribbon ficou descuidada e esqueceu completamente@dessas estranhas!
Estranhas?
Explicações depois! Apenas se preteja!@Se você estiver em perigo, mantenha distância.@Os ataques mágicos de Ribbon têm um alcance muito longo!

9000
Como um coelho, você precisa lembrar de uma coisa.@99% das pessoas com orelhas de coelho são falsas.@Eles os usam para atrair coelhos de verdade.
Você quase foi enganada!
Foi uma reação natural!@Faz um tempo que não vejo um coelho...
Mas quem são eles?@E por que eles vieram até mim de repente?
Basicamente, eles gostam muito, muito de coelhos.@São parte de um grupo chamado UPRPRC@e seu número de membros está crescendo!
Coelhos estão quase extintos...@Você provavelmente é um tipo de milagre, mas isso@também te coloca em grande perigo porque faz meses@desde que eles encontraram um.
Apenas tenha cuidado quando vir um!@Não tenha piedade! Quem sabe o que eles podem fazer com você!
Mas eu deve mesmo tratar essas garotas coelho desse jeito...?
Elas. Não. São. Coelhos.@Não pergunte o porquê mas Ribbon tem certeza que elas gostaram@do que você fez com elas.
...?
Apenas não pergunte, ok? Ali vem mais!
Rápido, pegue eles!...@Não importa, corra!@Pode ser que tenha mais deles!
As conversas se espalham muito rápido.@Devemos ir, ou vamos ser cercadas!
O-Okay!

9002
Acho que estamos a salvo agora, mas seja cuidadosa.@Pode ter mais à frente!
Ribbon! Ribbon!@Olhe! É a praia!
Você precisa ser mais cautelosa.@Nunca viu uma praia antes?
É realmente muito bonita!@Agora que pensei nisso, a Mestra@nunca me levou até uma!
Ribbon não culpa sua Mestra.@Com essas pessoas por aí, é óbvio porque.
É claro que eu não culpo a Mestra!@De acordo com alguém pra quem eu perguntei, se essa é a praia,@o próximo lugar é a ravina, e então vamos estar em Rabi Rabi Town!
Então é mais perto do que a Ribbon pensou! Continue andando!@Estamos quase lá!
Siim!

//VS UPRPRC2
28000
Nem sinal dela ainda?@Na verdade eu mesma nem acredito nas notícias...
Seja paciente!@Disseram que a coelha correu a Oeste da floresta.@Ela vai ter que passar por aqui!
Tem certeza...?
Apenas espere...@Peraí! Atrás! Atrás de você!@É ela!

28001
Então eles estão aqui também...@Bom, se não tem muitos... Erina, acabe com eles!
Acabar com eles... Não tem um outro termo?@Sinto como se estivéssemos recorrendo à violência.
Não, não é isso.@Ribbon apenas quer usar uma magia poderosa!@Ribbon geralmente não tem essa chance.
Então agora é a oportunidade da Ribbon mostrar a eles o que ela pode fazer!
magia poderosa...@Parece um pouco perigoso...

27500
Isso foi fácil!@Parece que nós fazemos um bom time!@Podemos com certeza acabar com mais deles!
Ribbon, se acalme!@Eu acho que você está muito animada...@Eu não consigo continuar! Estou cansada já!

27501
Ei! Fada!
...?
pelo amor de Deus! Pare de usar magia por aí!@Vai acabar acertando alguém com isso!
Oh, Ashuri! Há quanto tempo!
Hmm? Oh é você, Ribbon.@Desculpe, é que você parece menor do que antes.@Foi difícil te reconhecer.
Ei chega disso! Ribbon está tentando!@Não seja uma valentona!
Você definitivamente não parece ter encontrado um Mestre ainda.@E quanto a mim? Eu amaria ser sua Mestra!
Ribbon não quer uma vouyeur como Mestra!@E não fale sobre isso, tem pessoas escutando!
Mestre?@Você está procurando por um Mestre?
N-Não é nada!@Ashuri apenas fica falando bobagens!
...Hmm?
Ribbon, quem é sua amiga?@Ela não parece ser daqui.
Está falando de mim?@Olá, Sra. Ashuri. Sou Erina.@Na verdade sou uma coelha!
Espere, Erina, idiota!@Não diga isso à Ashuri!
Coelha... Erina... Essa coelha?@Então é assim que você se parece agora.@Sem dúvidas eu senti algum tipo de encantamento em você...
Oho... Bem, prazer em te conhecer Erina.@Algo aconteceu, então, com licença.

27502
Ah não. Julgando pela expressão dela...@Parecem más notícias.
Más notícias? Por quê?@Eu disse algo errado?
Ashuri ama estudar não-humanos!@Ela foi pega espiando a Ribbon@no chuveiro mas ela disse que só estava@fazendo uma pesquisa!
Foi assim que nos conhecemos!@Apesar disso, ela é uma boa pessoa e@é como uma irmã mais velha bem confiável!
Só que muitas pessoas já estão atrás de você,@então não se coloque em mais perigo.
Eu tenho um sentimento ruim quanto à isso agora...

//VS ASHURI1
5
Wow! Ashuri?
Hah...Haha... Ela está aqui.@Ribbon sabia que isso ia acontecer...
Droga, você desviou.@Então você já sabia o que eu estava fazendo.
Uma coelha humana e uma magia estranha...@Você vai me deixar te estudar, né? Só um pouquinho?@Tenho certeza que Rumi não vai ligar.
Pare com isso, Ashuri! Nós não temos tempo para isso!@Você pode fazer sua pesquisa outra hora!
Não! Nunca!@Erina não está interessada em ser estudada!
Para o progresso da grande área da magia,@Eu posso fazer qualquer coisa!
Venha, venha. Não se preocupe.@Quer que eu mude sua opinião com magia?
Espera... @Eu achei que você fosse a confiável irmã mais velha da Ribbon...
Você não diz sempre para Ribbon@não brincar por aí com magia?

700
Por que estão tão resistentes quanto a ser estudadas?@Dois contra um não é justo...
Vou continuar minha pesquisa outra hora.@Eu vou voltar!
Espere!@Eu não quero ser estudada!

701
Ribbon está com inveja da popularidade de Erina!
Não tire sarro de mim...@Eu não quero ser popular!@Eu só quero minha Mestra!
Certo, Certo, não se preocupe com isso.@Lembre-se, tem pessoas vindo atrás de nós@então vamos sair daqui!

//ERINA SEE RITA (AND SAYA)
26000
Essa é a pequena ravina? Mas não parece pequena!
Ribbon não gosta desse lugar...@Não parece como lá fora.@Plantas verdes são melhores!
......
Ei, Ribbon! Olhe!@Eu acho que já vi aquela pessoa antes!

26001
Muito obrigada.@Acho que é o suficiente por hoje;@Eu já estou me sentindo diferente!
Não sei porque você se sente assim,@mas... se você acha que está funcionando, muito bem!
Vamos combinar um dia então?@Eu preciso voltar e fazer a cerimônia na praia.
Ok, até mais então.@Vejo você na próxima!

26002
Ei, R-Rita! Espera!

26003
Quê?@Tem algo errado?
Rita... @Eu...
Na verdade...
......
Desculpa... Não é nada importante. Desculpa sobre isso.
Tudo bem, estou saindo agora.@Lembre-se, se você quiser dizer algo,@não mantenha só para você.
Sim... ok... obrigada.

26004
Eu falhei de novo...
Preciso me esforçar mais na próxima...

26005
Ahh! Você me assustou!
Não fique atrás das pessoas desse jeito!@Sério...
Eu lembro daquela pessoa!@A garota com cabelo azul, ela é uma amiga da Mestra!
Sua memória é muito boa, Erina...@Ribbon sempre pensou que animais não tinham memórias de longo prazo,@e até lembrança de objetos...
É claro que não.@Eu lembro de muitas coisas além de nomes.
......
Ei... Estou falando com vocês...@Olá? Podem me escutar?
Parem de me ignorar! Estou aqui!

26006
O que é isso-- Elas estão fingindo,@ou realmente não podem me ver?
......
Que droga! Não fez nenhuma diferença!@Ainda estou sendo tratada como ar!

26007
Umm... Você ouviu alguma coisa?
Não... Está escutando coisas?
Deixa pra lá. Esse deve ser o caminho para fora.@Em breve estaremos em Rabi Rabi Town!

//IN FRONT OF RABI RABI TOWN
15
Look! We've reached Rabi Rabi Town!
Wonderful! Ribbon thought it would take a lot longer!
But...
I suddenly feel a little worried@now that I'm close to Master.@Can I meet her looking like this?
Erina, what are you talking about?@Don't you want to return to your master?@Come on, let's go.
Okay...

99999
But actually... if you're not ready...@That actually works out pretty well!
What do you mean, Ribbon?
Well, a ton of things open up@when you finally meet your master,@so it's not that suitable for the demo.
So the story mode demo ends here!
B-But doesn't the game really begin@once I find Master in Rabi Rabi Town?
We didn't even get to explore and learn new things yet!@Do I ever get any aerial attacks?
You actually do, but it's not like@there aren't other things to do right now.
You can try the Boss Rush mode,@where you can battle a gauntlet of bosses.
You also get to meet characters not included in the demo.@Give it a try!
Is that so? Then it can't be helped...@I'll just hang around until I'm ready...
So you're not actually going to go anywhere?@I thought you were going to find your master...
Anyways, thanks for picking up the demo version!
Yep, thanks for playing!@Wait, what about Ribbon's friends?

//INSIDE RABI RABI TOWN
16
Wow, this is a really big town!
Finding your master in such a big place@will probably take some time.
......
Oh, come on, you worry too much.@Weren't you all for finding your master?

//ERINA MEET RUMI
30
......
Say... Ribbon?
What?
I see Master...@She's just up ahead...
Eh?
Already? That's a lot quicker than Ribbon expected!
......
I keep thinking...@Master won't be able to recognize me like this!@I can't just walk up to her.
Now that you mention it...@It would be rather odd.@She might even mistake you for one of them!
Oh, Ribbon knows!@Crouch down and hop over there like a bunny!@Then she'll definitely know it's you!
That's weird...@I would look pretty strange...
...But then again, if I could look like a bunny...@It just might...
Uhh, Ribbon was just joking!@Let's not fret over these things.@Let Ribbon meet your master!
W-Wait up!@I'm not ready yet!

31
Rumi...@You have a clue already, right?@There's no need to feel hopeless.
To see you like this, I...
Exactly! We found a clue, so now we just@have to get that thing running, right?
I'm not sure why my magic doesn't work on it...@but I will keep trying!
......
I... I'm not feeling down.
Sorry for making you all so worried...@I was just thinking about things.
I've decided on what I will do next.@Staying here won't solve anything.

32
...?
Umm... R-Rumi...? You can do it!
Uh... I just remembered something I have to do!@I'm off then... S-See you later!

33
Irisu? Is she okay?@What an odd way to say goodbye!
Rumi... Irisu is acting a little odd today.@I'm a bit worried...
Oh come on! Why is everyone so down?@This is not like Rabi Rabi Town at all!

35
Maybe Irisu's the one we need to be worried about.
She looks pretty troubled.
Hmm... Is someone bullying her?
Your guess is as good as mine.@We should catch her before she goes too far.
Hold on, I can deal with her.@You should work on that next step.
While I'm glad to see you every day,@it's the bright and cheerful Rumi@that really makes me happy!
Okay! I'll remember that.@Thanks, Kotri.
Hehe...

36
......
Really, though...@What in the world am I doing?@I can't let others worry...
Okay, I should get it together@and head to the Stone Stele first.

37
So close...@Master is right there...@She looks different too. Smaller...
Don't think too much about it. @You're human-sized now.@That's why she looks smaller to you.
Why does it surprise you at this point?@Haven't you met a lot of people already?
I'm just feeling so excited and nervous and...@I-I think I just need more time...
What if Master hates the way I look?@What should I do then...?
So that's what you're worried about!@If your master really loves you,@she's not going to mind.
Besides, she's seen us already.@Don't run away!
......
A bunny... and a fairy...?
Look, your master noticed you!@This is it!
......
M-Master...
......
Erina?
Eh?

38
...!
Wha--?!
This sensation... It's Erina! It's definitely Erina!
Where have you been? I was so worried!
M-Master... Erina can't breathe...
Sorry...@I'm just so happy!@You look a little different though...@Erina has grown a lot!!
It's wonderful! Master recognized Erina... @Otherwise...
Naturally! I'd be a poor master otherwise!
Erina is not really a bunny now...
Sorry, I was afraid Master might not like me anymore...
Of course not!@Erina is very cute like this too!
C-Cute...?
Erina, you always cared a lot@about your appearance.@You should be really happy with it right now!
Not sure...@Erina doesn't really understand@what's cute for humans...
......
Master, you're still squeezing me...
You... You don't like it?
No... it's just so incredible.@I usually sit on Master's hand...@I've never experienced this before.
......
Wow...

//INSIDE RUMI HOME
39
Then I saw the Stele warp Miru away@with you in her arms...
So Erina did see Miru there...
It didn't feel right...@She looked like Miru on the outside...
...but she felt like she was someone else.
Miru rarely visits the Stele,@so she shouldn't know how to use it.@Nobody here actually knows much about it.
Somebody is behind all of this,@but why...?
......
Hey...
Can we use the Stele to go back to the same place?@If so, we should get going!

40
That's true, I'm almost done researching the Stele.@If we can gather some magic users,@we can definitely try it out.
But Ribbon... do you really want to help?@It's really a lot to ask of you...
It's perfectly fine!@Ribbon is a very helpful fairy!
I don't want to suspect you of anything,@but something feels odd...
Master! You shouldn't use mind reading!@That's terrible!
M-Mind reading?
Yes, Master is good at mind-reading and telepathy.
But hopeless when it comes to magic...
I never thought I'd hear Erina call me terrible...@I read minds only when I really need to.@I just have this feeling...
......
Sorry... It looks like Ribbon must come clean...
That's right.@Ribbon came here for a reason...
Ribbon...
It's about your friends, right?@What's wrong?@I thought I was going to help you with that.
No... Ribbon's talking about@the reason she left the forest...
......
Hmm...
Well, you don't have to explain.@I understand now.
You do...?
D-Did you peek?! How embarrassing...@Ribbon wasn't ready yet!
M-Master?@What happened to "only when you really need to"?
......
Haha...@So that's the reason!
So you were hiding it because you're just embarrassed.@That's perfectly fine. I trust you, Ribbon.@Besides, I wouldn't want Erina walking around@alone.
...Oh.
Hehe... Well, if that's the case,@then I'm okay with it too.
Wh-What are you laughing about?!@And why is Erina laughing too?@Can you read minds as well?
Nobody was reading minds.@Ribbon's reason was embarrassing, right?@So it's not like it's something bad.
......
Boohoo... You tricked Ribbon...@You must be wondering what's so embarrassing...
If it's embarrassing, we should leave it for now.@Right, Master?
That's right.@It's no big deal, so let's get back on topic!
Now, you must find two people who know magic@while I finish studying the Stele.@I should be done before you come back.
Wait... So you really trust Ribbon?
Relax, everything's fine.@I must apologize for doubting you though.
No, Ribbon should apologize@because Ribbon was hiding something...
Okay, okay, didn't we decide to start?@Miru and Ribbon's friends are waiting for us!
Erina...
Okay!@Let's go!

100
To the west is the park@and beyond that is the tundra.@Check the map if you aren't sure!
Do you remember Miriam from the Item Shop?@You should stop by before you go.@She might have things that'll make your journey easier.
The shop...@Hmm...
Yes...@Although when Erina tries to remember,@it all feels a little hazy...
I'm sure it'll all come back once you go inside.
I've explained everything to her.@"If a cute bunny girl walks in, it's Erina".
She knows already?@How?
Remember telepathy?@It's a very useful ability.
Oh, cool.@We should get going then, Master.
Yes, it's time.
I almost forgot!@Take this, it might come in handy!

101
Hey... Your master said to go west, Erina,@which means we should head the other way!
But if Erina wants to go back to the ravine...@Ribbon is fine with that too.

//SHOP EVENT
7000
Erina...@It says "Welcome" above the door.@Could this be the shop?

120
Are you Erina?@You're just as cute as I imagined!
Hello, Miriam!@You're just as I remember!
Oh!@The memories really did come back!
Wonderful.@It's good to know that you're back safe and sound.@We were worried too.
You look a bit different, but that's not a problem.@It's great being able to talk to you again, Erina.
And you must be Ribbon. Rumi mentioned you too.@What a cute little fairy.
H-hello, pleased to meet you.
I heard the two of you are heading out of town.@I would love to help, but I don't know any magic.
The store has lots of useful items@and I can give them to you for free.@Any of these things should make your journey easier.
Free? That's too kind!@Won't it cause trouble for you, Miriam?
It's no problem. Sales have been pretty good.@Just take whatever you fancy.
Taking things for free doesn't feel right...@I want to try living like everyone else.
Aw, well if you insist...
Come take a look then.@Can I at least give you a discount?

121
Leaving so soon?@That's right, you're probably in a hurry.
Goodbye, Miriam.@When this is all over,@I want to come back and chat.
Oh, that'd be lovely. I look forward to it!
Hey, wait...@This is for you. Take it.@I'll be upset if you don't.

122
What's this? It's so pretty!
It's a magical item that helps you run faster.@I wish you a speedy return!
Thank you, Miriam! I'll use it well.@We're off then!
Yes, good luck!

125
Actually wait up!@I prepared this for you.
I think this will really suit you, Erina.@Here you go!

126
With this, the hammer can fly forward by itself,@allowing you to deal more damage.@Remember to hold on to it!
Thank you, Miriam. I'll be sure to use it!
That's everything for now.@I won't waste anymore of your time.@Good luck, I'm sure you can do it!
Yes, we're off now. See you soon!

//VS KOTRI1
27000
Hey! Irisu, wait!@Why are you running away?!
I bet she's at the library again.@One minute she's fine, the next minute she takes off@as if she's seen a monster...

27001
Ribbon, look! It's Ms. Fox!
...?
Weren't you... the human and fairy from town?
Strange... @Aren't rabbit-lovers banned from Rabi Rabi Town?
This is a misunderstanding!@Erina is not one of them!
Really?@But those bunny ears on your head...
......
Wait... Irisu ran off when she saw you...@Now that I think about it... It's you, right?
Umm, Erina, have you seen this person before?@Ribbon only noticed your master.
I don't think so...@But I think Irisu was the girl who was taking care of me.
Hey, I asked a question!.@Who are you?@Did you do something to scare Irisu?
She wore a strange expression all day today!@She may be shy, but that doesn't mean you can bully her!
It's not like that...@I did met Irisu earlier,@but she suddenly ran off on her own...
So this is your third offense!@Looks like you need to be taught a lesson!
Um... we only left Rabi Rabi a few minutes ago...@Are we getting into a fight already?

27002
Whew, leaving the forest was the right decision!@No annoying high fairies, so Ribbon can use@as much magic as much she likes!
High fairies?@There are different levels of fairies?
No, not really.@It's just how things are run in the forest!@Ribbon didn't like it but had to put up with it.
......
Ahem, you two seem to really like ignoring people...
Ah, sorry...
I don't think my magic is strong enough yet.@Could that be why it didn't work on the Stele...?
Anyways, please stop causing trouble for Irisu!

57002
Hey, wait!@We were misunderstood again...
Ribbon thought we would find a helper right away@but that was probably too optimistic!
The misunderstandings are probably all due to@those bunny ears... Even Ribbon was@misunderstood.

27003
Woah... What's this?!
All these bunnies in the sky! What's going on?
Bunny patterns?@Did those rabbit-lovers do this?
Maybe it's an island thing!@It's very pretty!
Hmm... Ribbon isn't sure either.@She's never seen this before.
......
When you look closely,@these bunnies are rather cute.
Really? Bunnies are naturally cute creatures though!
...?
What are you talking about, Erina...@What's all this about cuteness?
What... What do you mean...@Didn't Ribbon mention it first?
No way! Ribbon doesn't like bunnies at all!
Oh, you don't like bunnies...
......
Okay... Ribbon meant except Erina. Does that make you feel better?
Hehe, of course!@Ribbon should try to like bunnies though!
The problem isn't liking them,@it's finding them.
......
But really, what in the world is wrong with the sky?

27004
Hey... it stopped.
Umm... We can probably just ignore it.@We're not far from town yet so we need to keep going.
Oh... yes. We've only just gotten out of town...@but we've already used up a lot of energy...

//UPRPRC BASE EVENTS
886
Ribbon senses magic up ahead.@There might be someone there!
Really? Let's go take a look!

887
Ribbon can see it... It's not a magical person though...@It looks like a pair of shoes.
Are they magical shoes?@How are they different from ordinary shoes?
Well... maybe you can run faster, do special footwork,@jump higher, or even walk through the air?
Haha... Ribbon was just guessing,@Ribbon doesn't know what it can do at all.@If it's not a person, should we turn back?
Jump higher? If we could jump higher,@wouldn't that solve our problem?
Sure, but Ribbon was just joking about it...@Do we want to spend our time trying to get it?
We can't get to there from here though.@We'll have to go in from some other side.
It's okay, we're looking for people anyway.@Maybe we'll find a way around!

33000
Oh... looks like the road ends here.
No, it only looks like that.@See that? A secret passage!
You're right! Someone's coming this way too.

7003
They're really cute bunny-style shoes and they do@let you jump higher! With this, I can jump over@that ledge now!
Bunny-style...?@Did these belong to those bunny lovers?
Also, that was a bit dangerous.@Did we accidentally go through their base?@There were so many of them!@We should steer clear of this place!
Let's go back to that rainbow cave.@We shouldn't keep your friends waiting.
Yes, let's find a Warp Stone.@We can use it to get there right away.

//BEFORE VS CICINI
27
What's she doing?@Running off without paying attention to us at all...
And what's this?

28
A springboard?@Why is a springboard lying here...?@And just when we didn't need it!
Haha, it's nice, isn't it?@Let's go and find Ribbon's friends!

//VS CICINI
14
...!
It's Ribi! You're back at last!@We were so worried!
Thank goodness...@I thought something happened to Ribi...
Lilli, Pixie!@Ribbon found help!@We won't have to worry about that girl anymore!

190
...?
Who is it?@Can you not be so noisy over there?@I can't concentrate...
Ah...?
Hey! How did you get out!@Specimens aren't supposed to move around!
The girl didn't even notice Ribbon was missing.@She must be really focused on something.
Hey, little girl... let them out!@Ribbon has Erina's help this time.@Ribbon isn't afraid of you now!
What... Why do you have to complicate things?@I still have to get Syaro back you know!
I can't do research with my specimens running around.@Time for you lot to take a nap!
Not again...@Can't we resolve this peacefully?

1299
No! The system crashed... @Daddy gave me this as a birthday present!
Birthday present?@How can that be a birthday present?!
I won't forgive you!@This is not over yet!
There's more?! Stop it!

1300
......
How... How did this happen?
I-I'm sorry...@Please stop... Boohoo...
We wanted you to stop too, but you were smiling@while you attacked us! That was seriously scary!
But Daddy told me I have to fight back@against bullies or else I'll lose!
No, we're not here to bully you!@We just want you to let Lilli and Pixie go.
Besides, weren't you the bully?@How could you lock us up?!
...
......
I... I was just curious...@I'm really sorry...
I got really excited after finding unknown lifeforms.@I should really think about what I've done...

1301
I knew Ribi would save us!
Thank you! I really don't know how I'm gonna repay you.
We're friends. Why would you need to repay Ribbon?!
It was Ribbon's fault for leaving the forest...
It's not! We'll go anywhere with you, Ribi!@That was our decision!
Yes! So please don't say that, Ribi!@We're friends, right?
......
Umm... I'm Erina.@What's your name?
...Cicini.@My name's Cicini.
Pleased to meet you, Cicini!@I've got a question...@Is this your home? Why is it in a cave?
......
Well...@I'd rather not say right now. Sorry...
Is that so... That's okay.@I was just curious.
We do have a favor to ask.@We're looking for helpers at the moment...@Can you help us, Cicini?
...?

1302
The Stele... Is it that powerful?@This is important information!
I'll take a look...@but only because I'm curious...
As for magic... I don't know what that is.@I don't think I can help you with that.
Are you sure?@Weren't you using magic with that thing?
That? That wasn't magic!@That was just a computerized defense mechanism!
I don't understand what you're saying, Cicini...@but if Ribbon's right, you might be able to help us!
Wait, you said the system was using magic...@Could they be the same thing, but just...
Never mind that!@Show me the Stele you were talking about!
Say... our latest friend is...@kind of over-inquisitive...

1303
Hey, thank you, Erina.@If you don't mind, the two of us will head out first.
Eh? Leaving so soon?@Aren't you staying with Ribbon?
Ribi needs helpers, right?
We want to help, but we're not like Ribi.@Our magic is kind of weak.
Fairies are sensitive to magic users though!@So maybe we can find some information for you!
Thank you for your help,@but is Ribbon fine with that?
We've already agreed to do this.@It'll help things go faster.
Rumi wasn't sure how many people we'd need,@so the more the merrier.
Well, Ribi and Erina, we'll go on ahead.@See you later!
Thanks so much for helping!

1304
Um, do they know the way back?@It's a maze out there.
Relax, there's a Warp Stone outside!@They'll be back to the forest in a flash.
A Warp Stone... Such advanced technology?@Things are getting interesting!
You haven't used a Warp Stone before, Cicini?@That means we can only go back to the forest.
Haha... We'll have to walk back to town then...

1306
Did she really just run into town by herself?
She seems really interested in the Stele.@Maybe she's a Stele-lover?
Stele-lover? What a weird preference.
So... I have a question.
Ribi... Ribi...@I know Rabi refers to rabbit,@but what's Ribi? They kept calling you that!
It's just... their nickname for Ribbon!@Don't you ever call Ribbon that, ok?!
Haha... I don't plan to.@Ribbon sounds a lot nicer!
Alright... Let's stick to the plan.

//BEFORE VS RITA
17
It's so cold... We only just left the forest...
Ribbon's lived in the forest all her life@so Ribbon has never been here.@Are you okay, Erina?
It's fine... I've gotten used to it in the past...@but you should really wear more clothing!
Are you in a position to criticise Ribbon's clothes?
I had this on when I became human.@I don't know why I am wearing this either...
Don't your clothes represent bunnies?
...?

//VS RITA
7
A bunny and a fairy...@It's you two!
Eh... You are...@You recognize us?
Yes, Rumi told me.@She said a bunny and fairy were looking for me.@What an unusual combination.
No time for that now. Stay back!@Tell the fairy not to look up!
What do you mean?@Is there something dangerous?
No time for questions! We must go now!
......
......
Wh-What's happening?
Whoa, what's with this tension?@Are we just going to go straight to fighting?

800
Ack... So cold... Stop attacking!@What's going on?!
......
...Hmm?
What is it?@Did something happen?
What? A whole lot happened!@You kept attacking us!@You showed absolutely no mercy!
Oh, huh...@I'm so... dizzy...@I think I know what happened.
Um, so what happened?@You know about the Stele, right?
Sure. Sorry, I haven't introduced myself.@I'm Rita. I guess I'm a friend of your master?@It's amazing that you're like this now, Erina.
Also, your master is a bit silly.@I could've gone back directly.@There was no need to send you out here.
Yes!@Your master knows telepathy, right?@What are we doing here then?
Oh, nevermind... She does that all the time.@What can I say?
As for what happened... It's those sky bunnies.
Erm... Aren't they caused by those rabbit-lovers?
No, changing the color of the whole sky@is no easy feat, believe me.
Seeing it makes you obsessed with bunnies,@so it's quite dangerous for you!
Obsessed with bunnies...@So did we come at the wrong time?
Actually, it only started showing up@after you and Miru disappeared,@so maybe there's a connection.
Now's not the time for research though.@I'm going back to find your master in town.@If you've got nothing else to do, you should too.
Hmm, alright.@We'll see you back in town then!@Thank you Ms. Rita.
No need to thank me.@I wouldn't want to see Rumi like that again.
Very well, see you in Rabi Rabi Town.

//FOUND 3,5,7,10 MEMBERS
10
So we've found two helpers.@Time to head back and find Rumi.
We'll be able to use the Stele now, right?

11
Alright! We have enough people now.
We should go back to Rumi first unless you want to@do something else.@You decide, Erina.
Hmm, everything went smoothly this time too.@I hope we can fix everything soon.

12
Umm... should we head back now?
Yes, it's time to head back to Master!
This'll be the third time.@Three is Ribbon's favorite number!@Ribbon bets it'll work this time!
Haha, Ribbon is so cute.@I feel the same way too.
It will definitely work this time!@Let's go to the Stele.

13
That should total ten helpers.@Let's finish this!
Yes, Master should be waiting.@Let's head back to the Stele.

//RUMI ASK READY YET
40000
Thank you.@You made it back so quickly.
You're just in time. See the glowing Stele?@I've just found the way to trigger it.@We can start at any time.
This thing's magical power has gotten a lot stronger,@but is it enough?
Hmm... It's just as I thought.@Starting it doesn't do much.@It still needs some more mana.
That's not a problem!@We've got helpers, right?@We're pretty much ready!
You're right, but do you want to take a break first?@We can start now, but you shouldn't@push it if you're too tired.
I know you want to go...@but if you're afraid, I can take your place.@I should be the one taking care of this anyway...
No, I'm not afraid at all! Like I said...@Miru seems to want to see me too.
Yes, didn't we already say we'd do this?
......
Such serious expressions...@I guess there's no stopping you then.
Please get fully prepared,@and make sure to rest if you're tired.

40499
Ready? Then let's start.@But first, a couple things...
I've deciphered the writings on the Stele.@It's actually quite easy to trigger.@We may be a bit over prepared.
We don't know where you will end up.@I just hope it's near my sister Miru.
So this is going to depend on luck...
The good news is, coming back is easy,@so we can keep trying until we get the right place.
Yes! The way back!@We keep forgetting about that!
Well, I'll explain that later.@It's about time. Let's get everyone together!

40001
Are you ready? The Stele has been reset,@but we can attempt it again at any time.
I must say this again: Rest well before you leave@and don't forget to stock up at Miriam's shop.

40002
A few things have happened... Let's try a third time.
A few things happened?@Master... is there a problem?
Ah... No, it's nothing serious.@Well, are you ready?

40003
Enough people already? That was pretty quick!@Could this be the last time?@I've only just gotten started.
Do you want to take a break?@Or are you ready to go?@It might get a little tricky this time around...

//BEFORE WARP
40500
Okay... Let's try this for the first@and possibly the last time.
Erina, your hand please?@This is for you.

40550
This is...@Did Master make this?
Yes, you could tell! That makes me so happy!
It's a lucky charm that Erina can use for protection.@It takes a while to recharge so be careful!
You'll also use this charm to come back.@The Stele shard inside works like a Warp Stone.
So I hold this lucky charm@and imagine where I want to go?@Seems easy!
Yes, and that was all that needed to be explained.@If everything's ready, let us begin!
Hmm... it's time.@Is Ribbon ready too?
Ribbon was born ready!@We can start any time!

40501
Okay... Time for the second warp! Let's go!

40502
This will be the third time.@I said we can keep trying, but...
It's probably best not to think about it too much...

40503
Could this be the last time? My heart is beating so--@You have to come back.

Alright, let's do this! Everyone, get ready!

//FIRST WARP (STREET)

Erina... Erina! Wake up!@A crowd has gathered around us!
Get up! Erina!

36001
...! That's a lot of people!
You're finally up!@Ribbon woke up just now and saw all these people@gathered here!
B-But I don't look weird or anything...@I still look human, right?
Sleeping here is weird enough!@Let's go, we don't want to attract attention!

36002
They all walked past us... Whew...
Luckily there aren't too many people here.@We almost got rushed!
Say, this place is strange.@The houses are all so tall...
This air is strange too.@The air felt better on Rabi Rabi Island.
After looking more closely, it's no wonder.@There are so few plants here.
We should get going.@Standing here is making me feel dizzy...

36003
So, where should we go?@Is this where you saw Miru?
Nothing like this... It was indoors.
If there are no clues...@I'm not even sure if we're nearby.
So... let's go on instinct then.@If only we sensed some kind of magic.
......
Wait... magic?@Why is all the magic coming from that direction?
Let's go take a look!@It's our first clue!

Oh man... Ribbon really, really needs a bath right away!@They were all over me!
You too, Erina.@It was terrible with that crowd and all!
Um, you're taking this pretty well, Ribbon...@Shouldn't we be more scared or something?

//THIRD WARP (CITY)
17000
Great! You recovered quickly this time.
Are... Are we there?@This time it's...
Ah! It's this place.@Are we going to meet those people again...?
......
We have no choice but to keep going@in the direction we went last time.
Yes! The only direction with magic!@We must succeed this time!

33333
You're back again?@It's too early so what's the rush?@Can't you come back later?

33334
Oh, and a nosy little fairy too.
I'm nosy?!@Who are you?
...Hiiiiii.
Hihihi... What are you talking about?@Aren't I Erina?
......
You're called Erina?@That's my name as well.
That's not exactly right.@Erina is actually going to be my new name.
We don't care about your name changes!@What are you doing here, and why did you stop us?
I don't remember telling you to stop.@All I said was:@You. Are. Too. Early.
What are you up to?@Is Miru involved?@Where is she?
Oh my, how impatient!@You'll find out soon enough!@I don't have time for you right now.
Why don't you come back next time without your@useless tiny partner.
Why... Why you!@You can't talk to Ribbon like that!
......
Of course I can...@Want me to prove it?

33335
Oh dear, oh dear. You're really all over the place@aren't you, little fairy?
Urgh!@Erina... get away from Ribbon!@She's targeting Ribbon!
But... But...
Hehe...

33336
Hehehe.@Scared now, little fairy?
I don't have time to play games with you,@so I'm just going to leave you out here.@See you soon, but not too soon!
Let this be your last warning, little fairy.@I don't need to see you again.

//BACK TO RABI RABI TOWN (1ST)
43010
Master told us it might not work the first time,@but I wish it had.@We might have found Miru already...
It's okay. We'll just try again.@We'll succeed eventually!
Should we find two more helpers?@This really takes up a lot of mana.
It's alright, we're well rested,@so we can go again.
Ribbon got all fired up and excited!@But we were there and back again in just ten minutes.
But that was... @Is something trying to stop us...?
I don't think anybody knows for sure...@I just hope we don't run into them again.
Well... time to trigger the Stele again.@I've made a mark on the map.@I hope you can find someone there.
Understood. Let's go then!
Yes! We'll be back soon!

//BACK TO RABI RABI TOWN (2ND)
43020
......
......
Why... Why do you look so exhausted!@We can try multiple times until we succeed.@There's no need to push yourselves like this!
It's nothing...@We're just a little sleep deprived.
We should be up anyway.@It's the third try now.
Did you go and take another bath?@You had two baths yesterday...
It's... nothing.@We've just been a lot more active lately.
Y-Yes, that's it. We've been getting all sweaty.@We needed some extra baths to freshen up!
Are you okay? I've just got this strange feeling...@Don't push yourselves too much and try to get@some sleep before you go.
We're still not quite used to this,@but we'll be back in good spirits soon!
Yes, we're ready to go again!@We'll do it this time!
Hmm...
Say... that person you met...@She said you were too early.@What do you think that meant?
I have no idea...@But since she wants us there,@we'll probably find out.
Yes, we should.@I may need three more helpers this time.@The Stele is like a mana sinkhole...@Just two more might not be enough.
No problem,@I feel much better now too. Let's get started!
Right, see you later then!

//BACK TO RABI RABI TOWN (3RD)
43030
So what you're saying is...@You think that person took Miru.
Who can it be?@If she really is a bunny, it can't be anyone we know...
Bunnies disappearing, bunnies in the sky,@Erina taking on human form and Miru...@If these events share the same cause...
Master, there's no point in guessing...@I should set off again with Ribbon now!
...It's nerve-wracking! I hope the culprit appears this time.
This looks like the Stele's last run,@I hope nothing happens underground...
Underground?
It's nothing... We also need three people this time.@Find them and come back right away!
I added a mark on the map.@Head there if you can't find anyone.

//CICINI REQUEST (1ST , IN TOWN)
42
Erina! Ribi!@Are you back?

43
Did you have trouble? You came back so soon...@Don't give up, okay?
Hey, you need more helpers, right?@Could you help me find Syaro?
Syaro? A friend of yours?@Were you separated from them?
...? I've been doing some analysis on her location@and now I have a good idea where she is!
Analysis? You can analyze something like this?
Of course. I just use my computer to receive and@process the signals!
Computer?@Cicini always says complicated things...
Haha, don't worry about it.@I doubt you could understand it anyway!
Wait! I've always thought you were a little odd.@You seem to be hiding a lot from us!
Ahh... don't look at me like that!@I want to explain but it's a little difficult to...
If you really want to know...@Go to where my friend is. You'll understand!
Hmm...
What do you think, Erina?
It'd be nice to find more helpers!@I'm curious about Cicini's story too.
Uh oh...@The curiosity is spreading...
It's decided then!@Let's warp you to the place I found!@This invention works without a Warp Stone!

44
Great! Thank you!@Let's get started then!
We've warped all over the place lately.@I hope nothing bad happens...

45
You can't back out now.@This is my last chance!@This device is almost out of power!
Yes, yes, let's warp already.

46
Is this the ruins beyond my home forest?
Have you warped yet?@I'm quite confident about this device!@It's great, isn't it?
Yikes! Where did that voice come from?!
Don't underestimate our technology!@Voice transmission is very simple.
It's amazing... and convenient too!@Which way should we go now?
Hmm...
You're a little farther away than I expected...@Just keep going. I'll let you know when to turn!
Hmm, Ribbon hopes nothing strange happens again.

//MEET IRISU IN RUIN
32005
Hey Cicini, are you there?@I have a question.
I'm here. What is it?
Just out of curiosity, are you following us...?
Not really. I'm tracking you on the computer.
Because I feel like someone's watching us...

32006
Ah? So it was Ms. Irisu!
...!
Oh, uh, yes... What a surprise!@I didn't expect to meet you again here.
Since you know my name already, I'll just skip@the introductions and... I-I'll be off then...
Wait! I wanted to say thank you.@I really appreciated you looking after me.
It... It was nothing.@I couldn't ignore something like that...
Well, if there's nothing else, I must go.@See you later...

32007
The dancing fox girl was right.@She leaves the moment she sees you.
Does she dislike me?@If that's the case, I'd really like to know why...

//PATH TO LAB
32000
Erina, Erina!@Can you hear me?
I can hear you. Are we going the right way?
Change of plans.@Do you see the way down from there?
Yeah, there are two holes.@Which one should I take?
Hmm... There should be three holes.@I see three downward paths here,@but they're all the same.
Go down from there, turn left,@and then head further down.@That should put you on the right path.
Okay, we're heading down...

32001
Well, you can look around if you like...@Just remember that you need to head down.

30000
Thank you! This is it!@Just go inside!
Is this... a cave?@It's so dark! Ribbon hopes it's not dangerous.
Not at all. There's just a minor problem.@Go in and I'll explain everything.
Let's go inside then, Ribbon.@We can't turn back now.
Hmm... Ribbon has a bad history with her,@so Ribbon doesn't really trust her...
However, if Erina says so, then Ribbon can't say no.@Let's go inside.

//REACH LAB BEFORE CICINI ASKED
30010
It's so dark already and it might get even darker!@Do we really want to go in here?
Hmm... It's not marked on the map either.@We should turn back.

//PATH TO COMPUTER ROOM
30001
Isn't this supposed to be a cave?@You better have a good explanation for this...@Why is something like this out here?!
Hmm...@I'm reminded of the places the Stele took us...
Exactly, Erina! We can't be sure yet, but these strange objects@may have come from there.
I'm going to be frank now.@I also came from that place...@...Do you understand what I'm saying?
......
That's... unexpected...@Why did you only tell us now?
I didn't know anything about this place.@Who knew what would happen if people here found out!
While I was in Rabi Rabi Town, I realized that I was@being too paranoid.@It's really peaceful here!
Okay... now for some instructions.@Can you get to the Computer Room?
If the computer is left to idle for too long,@it'll go into lockdown mode. Once it enters lockdown,@Syaro could be trapped forever!
Lockdown mode?@That sounds complicated...@I just need to find the computer, right?
Yes, just keep going.@Some things may try to stop you,@but it shouldn't be a problem for you!
Hmm... this is getting interesting!@In we go then!

30002
UNKNOWN LIFEFORMS DETECTED@DEFENSES ACTIVATED
Woah, Cicini?@You sound so mature all of a sudden...
...? I wasn't talking.@Have you triggered the defenses?
Wait, aren't we helping you find your friend?@Why are you doing this?!
S-Sorry, I'm really sorry...@I have no control over the facilities there.@I'm surprised the defense system is even running!
Who were those girls with the blank stares?@They started attacking without a word!
Those are my robot maids.@They're like golems!@They're designed to attack strangers!
That's just dangerous!@Didn't you say it wouldn't be too hard?
Sorry... The lab is in surprisingly good shape.@Anyways, just get to the Computer Room!

30003
The Spectral Cave? Why is it here?
......
Basically, this is where my room used to be!
Don't worry about that detail!@There's no time! Just find the computer!
If you're here that means you went the wrong way...@The Computer Room is the other way...
But there are only small passages left...@What now?
Small passages...?
The lab layout must have changed...@Can you somehow get through the small passages?

30500
That sound... Was it Mr. Big Box?@I made it last summer and added it to the defenses!
Uh, Cicini...@That thing was quite dangerous, you know...
Not at all!@A science project like this was probably@a piece of cake for you!
That sounds rather irresponsible.
But it was rather interesting!

31003
Is this the Holo-Defense System?@So, it's still working normally too.
This hologram is the lab's final defense system!@You're almost there!

31004
......
Sorry about that...@The lab's systems were more intact than I thought.@This is taking too much time...
......
Well, we promised, so we can't really complain.@Right Erina?
Yes, and didn't you say we were almost there?@I want to find your friend!
Erina... Ribi...@Thank you so much...
Alright! The next level is where we want to go.@Keep your guard up just in case though!

30004
Yes! This is the place!@Now that you're here...@I have the coordinates for the Computer Room!
Erina, see those knobs that you can press?@Press any of them to prevent the system@from going idle.
Knobs that I can press...@Like this?
Yes, thank you.@That means Syaro is safe for now!
Hey, where's your friend?@We've reached a dead end, but Ribbon doesn't@see anybody...
Well...
I guess it's time to explain how everything happened...
Where should I start... Umm...@I guess with my father's latest research.
Usually he'd let me participate in his studies.@But this time, I guess he didn't want me to get involved.@He wouldn't even answer any questions I had.
I was afraid his team was up to no good so I snuck@into the lab and took their project!
Syaro and I were studying the device when it suddenly@turned on! When we woke up, we found ourselves@here in this world along with a part of the lab.
If that's the case,@shouldn't Ms. Syaro be with you then?
Yes, but when we arrived...@We immediately tried to turn on the device again@to see if we could go back to our world.
It didn't work. Not only did we stay here,@but Syaro got sent into the computer system@and I was moved with my room to that cave...
System? Where is that?@Is it around here?
Yes, but it's not accessible right now because only@a part of the Lab was transported here.@I have to patch the system first to make it safe.
Now that you've found the computer,@I can start with the repairs.@I just hope they won't take too long.
That's all I need you to do for now.@Thank you, let me warp you back.

30005
Uh... we're going back already?
Hey... don't start warping us without warning!@It's scary!

30006
Welcome back! I missed you!
Thank you so much.@I wouldn't know what to do without you!
You sounded really serious,@but now you're just like a little kid.
Say, we haven't found any helpers yet.@You should hurry and fix that system of yours!
Hmm... didn't you say you were in your own room?@Why are you here now?
To simplify things, I came to Rabi Rabi Town too.@Being warped straight to town should also be@more convenient for you.
Oh yes! Your friends are looking for you.@They're over there.

30007
Ribi! Erina! Welcome back!
You know, we found some people who know magic,@but we didn't dare to talk to them...
I've marked them on the map!@I hope this helps.
Thank you. With this information,@we now have more options!
By the way, we'll be going with Cicini.@We haven't finished yet!
Going with Cicini?@When did you become so close?
Hehe, when you see eye to eye on various things,@it's simple.
Oh yes, I found this. I can't use it myself,@so consider these a thank you gift!
This is too much! Are you sure?
Please don't say no. It'll break my heart.@I've already wasted a lot of your time...
We'll be off then.@I'll call you when the system has been patched!

30008
We went all that way, but we didn't do much!@Where will we go next?
How about we stop by Miriam's shop?@We can prepare before we set off again.

Hey, we're not bad people. We would like your help!
No. Vanilla won't listen.@People with fake bunny ears are all liars.

So it's because of the bunny ears.@Why does this keep happening...
Look! These are real bunny ears. Not fake!@Not like the others at all!

Yes, I was once a bunny,@but I was somehow transformed...
How unusual.
Sorry... Vanilla didn't know.@Vanilla always thought bunny ears meant bad people.@Sorry for being rude...
There's no need to say sorry...@Vanilla's reaction was normal.@I'm scared of those people too.
In that case, do you have some free time, Vanilla?@We need people with magic to help us.
You need help... Where?
Rabi Rabi Town, of course!@Master Rumi is waiting there for us all.
But... Vanilla is still looking for her big sister...
Leave it to us! We're good at finding people!

Are you sure?@Vanilla going to Rabi Rabi Town instead....
......
But Vanilla wants to see Rumi too...@Vanilla kind of misses her.
Bah, your master is way too popular...@Vanilla's ranked her above her own sister!
Vanilla is counting on you then.@Please find Vanilla's big sister...

29107
We were lucky Vanilla finally understood.@I've had so many mix-ups looking like this,@I really don't need anymore...
Yes, she's kind of different, isn't she?@Ribbon thought she wouldn't understand.

No! Like the cat ears on your head,@these are real bunny ears!
...Real bunny ears?
You must be joking!@I might look like a kid, but you can't fool me!@I will not join your creepy group!
I can't find my sister because of you creeps!@Why can't you keep your hands to yourselves?
Actually, we found your sister already.@She's heading to Rabi Rabi Town.@We came here to let you know!
I know you hate people with bunny ears,@but can you listen to our explanation?
You just sound really suspicious...@I still have to find my little sister!
I really hate you people...@I should make you rethink your life choices!

Hey... can I take my bunny ears off?
...Of course not. What are you even saying?

And people think it's a tourist attraction,@so they're all over the place!
Centuries... That's a really long time.@Who are you, ancient lady?

I am the owner of this pyramid.@People used to call me Princess Pandora!

No, we're friends.@Hey, Ms. Pandora, can I ask you a question?

Really?@Oh, thank you, Miss... I mean, Princess Pandora!
So, it really is a habit.@I guess you don't have to call me Princess.@I won't make it difficult for you.
But... you said something about a master?@So slavery is still around after all these years...
That's not true!@I'm Master's pet, not her slave!

No, nothing like that at all.@We came to ask for Ms. Nieve's help!@We hope you can come to Rabi Rabi Town.

Of course not.@Why is everyone on this island so distrustful?

I don't see a problem, but why isn't Nixie back yet?@It's been a while and she should be back by now...
How about this: I'll go find my little sister.@When I find her, we'll go straight to Rabi Rabi!
Yeah, that sounds good!@Thank you, Ms. Nieve.@We really appreciate your help!
Thank you for playing with me too.@I'm off then!@Now Nixie...

//NIEVE REQUEST
30105
Ah!@You're here! Wonderful!
Ms. Nieve?@Aren't you looking for your sister?@Have you found her?
No, I haven't found Nixie yet.@She said she was going up Mt. Snow...@But...
Can I ask you for a favor?@Mt. Snow is a little high in places...@She might be too high up for me to get to!
Mt. Snow...@What's your little sister doing there?
I... I don't know.@Can you help me look for her?
Of course! Mt. Snow is in the Tundra right?
Yes, but you might have to head to the eastern side.@There should be a path up the mountain from there.
Thank you!@We'll meet up there then!

//VS NIXIE
25
Hey, is that Ms. Nieve's little sister?@They look almost identical!
......
You are...
Hello! Your sister is looking for you!@You might get lost out here...
......
There's an odd look in her eyes.
......
Umm... Can you come back with us?@Your big sister is very worried about you!
Come to think of it, where's Nieve?@Didn't she say she'd wait for us here?
......
......
...?
What's that?!@It's that music again. What's she doing?!

400
......
...?
Are you alright?@You don't look too good.

401
Nixie! There you are!
Sister...
So you managed to get here by yourself.@But what were those noises?@Did something happen here?

402
So what happened just then?@The sky bunnies didn't appear so why did you@attack us?
Sorry... Rita said to not eat these plants.@But I was just so curious.
Ah! Did you eat them?!@Even when I also told you not to!
Plants?@I only see these trees here. What plants?
The plants around here!@Strange plants that look like dessert!
They're supposed to taste quite nice,@but Rita said eating them makes you dumb...@For heaven's sake!
......
I... I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry...@I caused trouble for you.
Thanks a lot for your help.@I just need to have a chat with my sister.@Please excuse us....
We'll definitely come over and help.@See you in Rabi Rabi Town!

403
Great! Another problem solved.@Helping other people is so fun!
It went well too!@We now have two more helpers!
Still, these plants...@Ribbon doesn't think we should leave them here.@They probably make you see things.
Really?@They look delicious.@It's hard to imagine them as dangerous...
A dangerous but beautiful plant...@How terrible!@We should get out of here.

//FOUND COCOA IN CAVE
26
Oh... it's Ms. Kitty!
It's you... You are...
......
Hey, are you Erina?@Sorry about what happened last time.@It was the bunny ears that confused me.
Rumi told me about you, but I couldn't believe it!@So you look like this now!
Great! I wanted to be friends with Ms. Kitty.@Everything seems to be okay now!
Don't call me Ms. Kitty... My name's Cocoa!@Just call me Cocoa.
I don't know why you're in human form,@but it's good that you're back...@Your master was so worried about you!
Right, so I'm not sure when, but this area just opened up.@There may be something valuable here.@It might even lift me out of poverty!
I'm in a bit of hurry.@If I can't find anything, I might have to live@out of a box soon...
Hey, are you looking for treasure?@We can help you!
Other than your master,@I don't want to rely on any more people.@I'd be such a failure!
Is that so?@Then good luck, Ms. Cocoa!
Well, off I go then.

//VS COCOA
95
Ms. Cocoa? Strange... Why are you still here?@We thought you went the other way.
How... How can this be?
Umm... Ms. Cocoa?
Why did I go the wrong way?!@Did you find something already?
...?

96
......
It doesn't matter if you got there first.@Erina is a rabbit after all.
...?
You look pretty valuable. I'd love to take you home...
Yikes! It's even happening underground!@Just dont look. Just don't look up!
I-It's happening again?@Didn't we clear everything up with Ms. Cocoa?
......
No, I'd love to take you home...@But if I sold you to those people, I could make lots@of money and no longer be poor.
She's beyond help!@Her desire for money runs really deep!@We better make a run for it!
Run? Don't go!@I'll sell you and escape poverty forever!@Come with me to Rabi Rabi Town now!

902
Did this really happen again?@I'm no match for you after all...
But...
My acting was pretty good, wasn't it?@You looked really scared!
Acting?
I knew you two would decide to come down.@I was going to use the treasure as an excuse,@but the phenomenon came in handy too!
I already knew about this sky thing@and as it turns out, it has no effect on me!
So you weren't under its control?@Then why...
I needed an excuse to test the items I made.@They've improved a lot, haven't they?
......
Please, please don't do that again.@I was really shocked...
It's dangerous!@There were so many different kinds too.@That's a bit too much for a joke!
Haha, sorry, but you wouldn't have agreed if I asked@directly. If you knew from the start, this wouldn't be@much of a test!
Even though it was an act,@I actually meant some of the things I said.@Want to know which ones were genuine?
No, don't tell me...@I don't want to know...@because I don't want any of it to be true.
Is that so? What a pity.
I guess my exploration is over.@You're looking for help, right?
These items worked quite well@and should be of use to you.@I'll wait for you in Rabi Rabi Town!
Oh... the items you tested were made for us?
Ah, so you must be Ribbon.@Yeah, I guess you can put it that way...
Rumi's been helping me almost everyday.@She's probably sick of doing this.@I must try and repay her somehow...
No way!@I might be a bunny, but I know that every night,@Master looks forward to seeing Ms. Cocoa!
......
Really? That makes me kind of happy.@And a little embarrassed...
So Erina knows I ask Rumi for food every night?!@That's so embarrassing... I better leave now!@See you in Rabi Rabi Town!

903
Ms. Cocoa looks a lot happier now.
Why do you say that?@Wasn't she always like this?
Well, when she went to Master's house for food,@she always cried while she ate.@I felt really sorry for her.
She cried while she ate?@Wow, life must have been really tough...
It's good to see her like this.@It must be because she's friends with Master now!
Still, I wonder where she lives now...@Why would she have to live out of a box?

Cicini? So did you fix the thing?
Yes! I finished patching it just now!@You can go into the System to find Syaro now!@Please find her, this is my last request...
Don't be silly.@We'll see this through to the very end.
Where do we go now?@Back to that blue place?
Yes, go back to the Computer Room.@I'll explain things when you get there.
I'll go back to my room then.@I'll be able to tell when you're in the Computer Room,@so you can go whenever you like!

Remember to check the map,@they've all been marked down for you!
Thank you, we'll keep trying! Don't worry!
Wait, you two... How did you get here directly?
Well, Cicini gave us this thing that lets us warp@without using a Warp Stone. It's pretty amazing!
......
You're all pretty close now.@You must have forgotten all about Ribbon...
Haha, Ribi is jealous!@Of course not! How could we forget you?
R-Ribbon was just joking!@If you forget her, Ribbon won't forgive you!
You're my friend too, Ribbon.@That at least makes you equal to Cicini!
Um...Does it work like that?
Uh, you probably need to get to your next destination.@We'll stop taking up your time.
Remember to check the map!@See you later!

Haha, Ribbon was jealous...

We hear you.@Well then, Ribbon...@Ready?
Yes, let's press it and go!

Hmm... So those empty-eyed girls are here too?

But if Syaro is here, these maids should not@be active. That means...
Err... Never mind.@Beware of these maids!@They are immune to close range attacks!

31002
Hey, Erina,@Ribbon thinks we forgot to say something.
Now that you mention it...
Hey, Cicini! This place is amazing!@Is it really inside that computer thing?
Yes! Our technology advances every day and@these things are the fruits of our progress!
Shouldn't you be used to strange occurences by now?@You reaction seems a little slow...
Well...@We've been to a lot of weird places lately@so it didn't seem that strange at first!

Hey! Be careful!@The System is quite complicated on the inside.@Don't fall into the holes!
You'll get seriously hurt.@So watch out!
Okay, we'll be really careful.

Of course it's not Master.@But why is there a bunny girl...@and some unknown lifeform here?
...?
Cicini!@We see one of those maids, but this one talks!
Are you from that place?@You really shouldn't be here...
We mean you no harm.@Cicini told us to find you...
Cicini, can you hear us?@Is this Syaro?
......
Of all the times for her to be away.@Such bad timing!
Cicini?
You know Master's name.@Did Master send you?
......
So she's safe?@That's great news.
......
But you really need to go! Please leave!
I can't control myself inside the System!@Go tell Master there's an issue with the ID system!
No, this is not just an issue... It's a bug, a bug!@Master's creations always have them!

Hello, are you Ms. Syaro?@Cicini sent us here to find you...
Yes... I'm Syaro, and you are?@Have I seen you before?
Maybe a few minutes ago?@I'm Erina, pleased to meet you.@Cicini sent us to find you, Ms. Syaro.
......
Pleased to meet you, but what's going on?@Not many girls dress so... @So shamelessly...
Right, you mentioned Cicini!@That means Master is safe and sound, right?
Fantastic! I thought I'd never see Master again...
Um, sorry... I probably did something strange to you.@The System thought I was a robot maid.@Master's creations always have a bunch of bugs!
As long as Ms. Syaro is fine,@Cicini will be happy to see you!
......
Hey, Ribbon has a question.@Why do you call Cicini "Master"?
...?@Who's talking?
Is it that cute doll? An unknown lifeform!@It can fly and talk too! And it's so small...
Hey, Ribbon asked a question!@Ribbon is not a doll, and Ribbon is not that small!
You're called Ribbon?@Sorry, could you repeat your question?@You're so small that I can barely hear you...
Stop calling Ribbon small!@Ribbon said she has some questions!
Syaro looks a lot like those robot maids...@Did Cicini's father create you?
No... Cicini said she's a friend,@so why would a friend call her Master?
In terms of age, Cicini looks younger too.@How odd.

1201
Wait, Ribbon! Look!@Syaro is a human!
Yikes! Keep... Keep your hands off me!@That was very sudden!
......
Yes it doesn't feel hard like a robot.@It's like normal skin!
Didn't I say to keep your hands off me?!
Honestly!@Yes, I do look like the robot maids,@but I'm a person, not a robot!
As for the master thing, it's too embarrassing@for me to explain...
Well, I'm going to look for Master now!

I was very worried about you too...@But can you not suddenly hug me like that?
But... But...@Let me hug you, Master!@I really missed you!
Haha, come on.@You don't look like a big sister at all right now.
......
But...
Stop squeezing me like that!@I know you're really big there!@You busty monster!

A-Are you really going to tell them?
Of course! They've helped me out a whole lot.@Since they're so curious...
But... But...
No buts! I'm going to say it!

48
Okay, listen up!@We've been together since we were really little!
You... You're really going to tell them?@I want to be somewhere else right now...
We were actually born in the same year!@But Syaro magically stole all my nutrition@so I haven't grown at all...
We're really good childhood friends!@Because we were both interested in science and@research, we got along really well!
I really miss the good old days, though.@Things were more peaceful then...
It was all very normal until my dad and I moved@to the new lab. That was when the problems began.
Dad didn't like me bringing Syaro to the lab.@He told me not to spend time with her.@That I had to concentrate on studying@and research...
We didn't want that, but I had an idea.@I had Syaro dress up as one of the maids@so she could sneak in!
It proved to be very successful! No one knew!@The monthly inspections were a killer though!
Hold on... You can skip this part...
So Syaro has been calling me Master ever since.@It's weird, but I like her looking after me@and Syaro likes this arrangement too!
Ahhh! You didn't have to tell them that!
Hmpf. Well that's how it is.@I dressed like this to be with Master!@Okay, storytime's over. I'm going now!
Hey Syaro, wait!@We need to set a destination before warping!
L-Leave me alone!@I'll die of embarrassment if I stay here!
Ah... you're just too...
Bye, Erina and Ribi. I'll explain your situation to Syaro.@We'll see you in Rabi Rabi Town!
Sure.@See you later!
Wait, can't you take us back with you?

I'm fine with that too... but can someone@tell me what just happened?@It sounds unusually dangerous...
From what I can see,@the situation underground is getting pretty messy.

Umm... It's not over yet.@The situation at the beach is tricky...
The beach again?@What is this beach thing you keep mentioning?
I told you, it's a secret.@You can ask all you want, but I'm not telling.
If it's such a big secret, then why do you keep@talking about it?
You're right, but I only brought it up because@I wanted to ask you for a favor.
A favor?@What is it?
Rita and I have been working on something but@there's been a situation. She's at the beach@taking care of it right now so I could come@and find you.
I'd like you to get a crystal from@the Spectral Cave.@I can't leave Rita out there by herself for too long@so I might need to hurry back soon.
A crystal? What does it do?
The Rainbow Crystal contains powerful magic.@Our little accident today needs a little extra mana!
I plan to look for it myself once the situation@has stabilized. Are you willing to help us?
The Spectral Cave...@Isn't that where I met Ribbon?
Ribbon saw pretty crystals there too but do they@contain magic? Ribbon doesn't remember sensing@anything...
Well, roughly once a month, there's one crystal@that's completely filled with mana.@You have to go pretty deep to find it.
This seems very urgent.@We'll take care of it!
Oh, it's rare for Erina to get so serious@Let's get searching!
Thank you so much.@This takes a weight off my shoulders.
Oh yes... I hear that Kotri and Pandora are also@searching for the Rainbow Crystal. Don't let them@get to it first!
That's all. I need to head back now.@Later!

Kind of... maybe?@But if we can put a stop to this thing,@we might find the magical Rainbow Crystal!

It should be.@Such an active crystal must be incredibly magical.

Oh, it's you two?@Have you started looking for the Rainbow Crystal?
Ms. Ashuri? Why are you here?@Have you solved your problem?
I said I'd come over when things cooled down, right?
The situation is under control for now,@but the crystal is still a priority.
Well, we're a step ahead of you.@Look, we've found it!
No way! Already?
Great! This means that island won't be seen again!
What do you mean, Ms. Ashuri?
Haha, nothing, nothing...@Actually, I'm not sure myself...
Thank you, I'll take this back now.@Solving a problem feels good!
You can count me in on the Stele too.@I'll go back to town to help out as soon as possible.

Wait, what?@What are you doing, Ms. Pillar?!
Ms. Pillar...?!@Erina, you've definitely offended her.

1100
H-How was that?@I bet you can't ignore me now!
......
Strange... Where did Ms. Pillar go?@Why did she suddenly disappear?
Ribbon thinks it's probably the wind magic.@Is that why she's so hard to notice?
I'm not Ms. Pillar! I'm Saya!@I do have a name, you know!
...Eh?
H-Hold on.@Is wind magic really why nobody notices me?@Is that true?
Doesn't that mean I...

1101
Oh... She appeared again!@But she ran off...
She seems to have suffered a blow...@We should follow her.

//FOUND SAYA AGAIN
150
Why?@I really love wind magic, but is this the price I have@to pay for picking something unpopular?
No wonder Rita kept trying to teach me other magic...@Why didn't she just tell me?
Well...
If you want to be more noticeable,@we know a way!

151
Oh, it's you two...@You can still see me....
Ribbon has a proposal.@You could help Rabi Rabi Town.@If you help out, it'll make you stand out!
...!
Ribbon, we might be desperate for helpers but@we shouldn't trick people!
Of course not! Ribbon is serious!
Help out?@Did something happen in Rabi Rabi Town?
Didn't Rita tell you?@How unusual. She said she'd help too.
Basically, we want to find Master Rumi's@little sister.
Is that so...
......
...Wait! That might work!
I don't know if your proposal will work.@Even if it turns out to be false, I won't mind.@As long as I can be with Rita!
It's decided then!@I will go to Rabi Rabi to see what's happening!

152
......
I guess we can take that as a "yes".@That was quick.
We found another helper, but I can't@shake off the feeling that we lied to her...
Hey... Ribbon was just making a suggestion!@It wasn't a lie at all!
Anyway, as far as she's concerned,@Rita is more important than being noticeable.
Haha, it does seem that way.@Well, if Ms. Pillar is happy, then that's great.
......
What was her name again?

//ENTER DARK AREA
43555
......
S-So dark! I can't see a thing!
Hey, should we keep going?@It might be unsafe...
We need something that glows...@but where can we find something like that?
It's your call whether to keep going, Erina.@Ribbon's fine with anything!

//VS UPRPRC4

It worked! It worked!@The bunny finally walked into our trap!
Bunny, bunny! We're coming for you!@Get ready, everyone!

161
Invisibility?!@Wow, these people are tougher than they look!
Looks like there's no way out of this...@Careful, Erina... there might be more of them!
They came out of nowhere...@Bunny girls, please don't blame me for this!

162
I thought they had given up...@I guess I was wrong.
Uhh...really? Them giving up?@You're such an optimist!
But Ribbon feels better now.@Ribbon actually feels less anxious when she sees them.@Maybe it's the darkness...
It's pretty creepy in here.@Seeing other people here does feel comforting!

//VS ARURAUNE

Anyone? Is anyone there?@Can someone help me?
...?
Ribbon, did you hear someone calling for help?
Yep! Ribbon heard it too.@It came from over there!
Let's go and take a look then!@It was very faint, so it might be further in.

889
I'm nearly done for...@Help... Can someone help me?
It sounds closer! We're almost there!
Not almost... It's pretty much right in front of us!@Let's go!

29200
Help me... Is anyone there?@A terrible creature is attacking me!

29201
Oh! Finally, somebody came! I'm so happy!
......
Well...
Were you calling for help?@Where's the terrible creature?
Um, that would be me.
I haven't sensed anyone here for ages...@So I called for help to get you to come here.
So we were tricked here...
Hello, I'm Erina.@I haven't seen your kind before!
Sorry...@I don't remember my name,@but the other plants call me Aruraune.
I'm not from a different race either.@I used to be human too.
Human?@But your body...
I don't remember much but I was attacked@deep in this forest...
By the flower that is now my lower half...@And now I look like this.
I-Is that so...@Sorry... I thought Ms. Aruraune was born like this.
Well, human-shaped plants do exist.@Ribbon has run into them before,@but a parasitic plant...@How unusual...
It's okay, I wanted to end it all...@so I came all the way out here.
It's actually better like this.@The world looks more beautiful now.
......
......
......
You're probably wondering why.@Sorry, it's a little hard to say...
N-No need to apologize!@It's okay if you don't want to tell us..
......
So this is the power of nature.@It's truly a symbol of hope!
Ms. Aruraune, I'm Ribbon, pleased to meet you.
Hello, Ribbon.@Lively fairies are a part of nature too.@Nice to meet you.
I felt afraid in this form at first.@I thought people would shy away from me.
When I finally decided to reach out,@it was too late and my body had become rooted here,@preventing me from leaving...
I've only had plants to talk to for a long time...@Sorry I tricked you into coming here...
I was really moved when I saw you.@I hope you won't blame me...
Not at all. If you don't mind, Ms. Aruraune,@Ribbon can even visit every day so you won't@be lonely!

29202
Really? I'm so glad!@Fairies belong in forests and should never leave.
How about you Erina?@Bunnies should stay here for...@...forever.
B-Bunnies...
......
Erina, something's not right.@The atmosphere's all weird...
Look! No, don't look up!@It's the bunny phenomenon again!
Is someone controlling this thing?@It's like they are toying with us!
What is it? Are you leaving me?@Didn't you say we'd be together?
We can be together...@But when you say "together"...@Is it a different kind of together?
Yes it is! Aruraune has been affected@by the sky bunnies!@We can't agree to that!
......
I will respect your decision.@If you want to leave, I'll let you leave...
Ms. Aruraune...
But...
It's about whether you can suc-ces-ful-ly leave...@Come and feel the beauty of nature.@You'll want to stay here forever....
...!
Erina, we have no choice.@She's been completely possessed...@We need to wake Aruraune up first!

29205
Aru... Aruraune!
Sorry, we were a little heavy-handed in waking you.
......
Wh-What happened?
Strange... Why am I here?@And I've been freed from the plants around me!
W-We don't know...@Maybe the forest wants Ms. Aruraune@to meet more people?
Perhaps... I don't know how this happened,@but I'm free at last! This is amazing...
Ms. Aruraune, there's something we need to tell you:@The reason we came out here...
We're looking for magic users@to help us in Rabi Rabi Town.@Can you come too, Ms. Aruraune...?
Rabi Rabi Town?@Where have I heard that name before...?
There's lots of kind people in Rabi Rabi Town.@You'll get to meet lots of them if you go, Ms. Aruraune!
Hmm...
I can help out if you like.@I should do something to thank you anyway.
Thanks! Ribbon is really glad to have met you!
So am I, or I might have@been stuck here forever...@I'm so lucky to have met you.
It might take a little while,@but I want to get to Rabi Rabi on my own.@It'll help me familiarize with the world outside.
Good luck then, Ms. Aruraune!@We'll see you later!
Oh, and find Master Rumi when you get to town.@She'll explain everything.
Okay, I will set off then.@See you around, Erina and Ribbon.
I'll come back, my forest friends.@Thank you too!

29206
Whew... Ribbon was so nervous.
Ribbon seems to like Ms. Aruraune a lot.@You were so polite!
What do you mean? Ribbon is always polite!
Ms. Aruraune just feels a lot like nature.@She's like the forest itself!

//VS KOTRI2

What? What do you mean?@You're joking, right?!

No, it was a little sudden...@but everything I said was the truth.
How could I have done such a terrible thing...
Irisu...
......
...!
Sh-She's here again!@Why?

66
Wh-Why is she here?@I can't do this yet.
Can you hold them off for a bit, Kotri?@My heart isn't ready yet...
Wait! Even if you aren't ready, I don't...
Sorry...@Please keep it a secret.@I promise I'll tell everybody soon...

67
Really... This is all too sudden.@Aren't you a little too secretive?!
What are you two doing here?@Still looking for someone?
You know who we are, Ms. Fox?
We've met before! My name is Kotri!@Only my hair color's changed.@Could you not recognize me?
Your hair color changed...@Is that normal?
Hehe, it's all thanks to my magic.@My magic is related to dancing!
Different dances can change my hair color.@Changing how you look everyday@is pretty neat, isn't it?
......
Forget about my hair for now.@Do you really want to go this way?@There's nothing to see here.
Nothing? But we heard that someone here could help us.
And was that Ms. Irisu?@She always runs off after a few words@and I really want to get to know her better...
......
There's something weird about this situation...
Oh, right!@Didn't you hate us the last time we met?@You seem to have forgotten all about it.
Hate you? I-Impossible!@Why would I hate cute girls like you?!@You... you must've been imagining things!
......
We heard something about a secret...@You probably already know why Irisu@keeps running away.
Oh, really?@Can you tell us, Ms. Kotri?
Wh-What?@It's nothing like that.@I don't know anything...
Hey, what's with all the questions?@Why don't we do some dancing first?
Look, she's changing the topic...@The sign of a guilty conscience?
I don't care!@I just need to keep you right here!

128
......
Good... This means Irisu can get further away.@That way, you won't be able to find her for now.
Won't be able to find her...?
What's the big secret?@Why do you need to hold us back?
Stop being so curious!@Once Irisu is ready, you will know.
As her friend, I can't tell you.@That's it. No more questions. I'm going now.

129
We probably won't get any answers...@Well, let's try not to worry about Ms. Irisu then.@Sky Island Town should be just ahead.
True... Did she forget that Rabi Rabi Island is@known for its overly-curious residents?

Hmm, I heard there were going to be visitors,@but I didn't expect a bunny and a fairy.
Are you lost, children?@How can I be of assistance?
Did you come here for that?@Let me assure you, I'm quite experienced.
Yikes... So this is a succubus?@Is she always this forward?
Erina doesn't really understand...@We're here looking for help.
What? Such a boring reason...
However, it's brave of you to come here@and ask for my help.
I'll gladly help, but only if you let me play with you@for a while. After that, anything goes...

1601
I-If you can help us, sure...@But letting you play with me?@Being played with sounds strange...
Erina! Don't you know what a succubus is?!@Don't agree to anything!
A bunny in human form.@I'm beginning to look forward to this.@So what's it going to be?@I'll help if you can satisfy me!
It does sound strange.@Sorry, but I need to think about it...
......
Sorry, I can't let you just leave whenever you want.@Just listen to me and stick around, little bunny.
Uhh... Let's get out of here, Erina!@I'd hate to see what that succubus@wants to do to you!
Oh my...@So you two won't give in like good little girls.@I can definitely work with that.
Because the naughtier you girls are...@The more excited I get!

You seem like two innocent kids,@but you're tougher than you look.
But that was fun in its own way.@I'll listen to your request.
R-Really? Well, we need magic users to help out@in Rabi Rabi Town.So, if you can...
Oh yes! I'm Erina, and this is Ribbon.@What's your name, big sister?
Aw, you've spoilt the mood.@Introductions should be done at night.
I'm Lilith, but I don't like that name much.@So keep calling me big sister.

Wait... Why are there more conditions?@Didn't we already defeat you?
No you haven't. Not until you've won an aerial battle.@I am far more powerful in the air.

Wait here, Erina!@Ribbon will challenge her alone!

20001
Hey! Ribi! Wait!

20002
Pixie? Lilli?@Why are you here?
The others saw you heading to Sky Town.@We came here because we were worried.
A succubus was spotted here!@It's a really dangerous area!
Asking a succubus for help wasn't a good idea.@Are you still going to chase after her?
If that's the case, then we can all help!@Three fairies should be enough to let Erina fly!
Let me fly?@If I can't move around freely in mid-air,@I don't know if there's much of a point...
Erina might not know magic,@but the two of us can perform some spells too.@It won't last long, but it should be good enough!
Yes! There's no time to waste.@The succubus has flown really high up now!

20003
Erina, don't think about it.@Let's just do it!
Right! Jump forward here, Erina!@Trust us! Once you jump, you'll start flying!
Here?!@Then I'm... I'm going to jump now.

20004
I'm really flying! This is amazing!
Pixie, Lilli, how long do you think this will last?
Maybe about twenty minutes.@We don't have enough mana to fly longer.
It can't be longer than fifteen minutes, Pixie!@We don't have much time.@Let's catch that succubus! There she is!

20500
This strong magic... we should be getting closer,@but there's no sign of her.
Urgh... Come out! We're running out of time!
If my ears could spin like a windmill,@I might be able to keep flying...
Do you have "Rose" in your name?@If not, then it's impossible.
Hey, we'll have to land soon@or Erina will be in great danger!
Landing already? But you're almost here!

You are serious!@You even managed to get up here.
We've caught up to you and we don't@have much time! Will you help us or not?

How about this?@Defeat me in the air and I'll say yes.
If you lose, you'll first get a good nap,@then fulfill our agreement.
Agreement? We never made any agreement!
No, it's okay, Ribbon.@Let's just not lose.
We have five minutes left. No time to waste!@Let's get started!
Oh... Oh no! I'm starting to feel unstable!
Hehe, the look of panic on your face is fantastic.@I can let this go either way!

Did we do it?@She's going down, let's follow her!
We're at our limit!@We need to use the remaining mana@to give Erina a soft landing!

Urgh... Did we find the wrong person?
Thank you, big sister.@Your help means a lot to us!
Haha, don't mention it.@Don't forget, I'll make you mine one of these days.

Rabi Rabi Town urgently needs a lot of magic.@Can you help us, Seana?

Well, I shall go perform on land at once!@Just find me in town if you need help!
But... But...@Weren't you afraid of being out of water?

Thank you...@I feel like a different person now!
I might be able to help you now!@I'll go back to Rabi Rabi Town!
We appreciate your help, Ms. Kotri!@I didn't know you were trying so hard for us.
With that magic, Ribbon believes you can definitely do it!@You've improved a lot!
Now I really want to try it out again.@See you in Rabi Rabi Town then!
Sure!@See you later, Ms. Kotri!

134
Kotri can definitely do it.@That also means we gained another helper!
That's great.@I've always wanted her help.
So she has her own troubles too...@With the Stele and taking care of Ms. Irisu...
Say, where's Irisu?@She wasn't with Kotri this time.
You're right. I know we shouldn't keep asking,@but I'm concerned about her.

//FINAL WARP (HOSPITAL)
18000
Are we there yet?@I can't see anything.
Erina? You stayed awake this time!@Ribbon was looking for you!
It's strange... The magic was much stronger this time,@but it's pitch dark around us...
......
...?@I think I can see something.

19000
This leads outside.@We should go the other way.

18001
R-Ribbon!
This looks a lot like where I was before!
I can feel powerful magic nearby.@Maybe we'll find Miru soon!
Could this be the last time?@We'll come back with Miru soon, Master.

19001
This is where I woke up!@These boxes! This mirror! I remember them!
Erina, if that's the case, that means...
Yes, that means we should be able to@find Miru upstairs! Let's hurry!

//MIRU ROOM
90
We were going through strange white passages@just now but this looks like a child's room...
This room...@I was in this room before I somehow woke up@in the forest...
But where's Miru?@I remember meeting her here.
This is frustrating. Ribbon thinks that person is nearby too.@Where in the world could she be?
Should we keep going?@There seems to be something up ahead.

91
It's a dead end.@Ribbon didn't expect such a small room.
This feels wrong.@Did we miss a passage?
The magic around here is the strongest.@Why is there nothing here? Is it a trick?

//VS MIRU
92
This room has completely changed!
And... And...@Is this... Miru?
Miru! We've finally found you.@Everyone's worried about you!
......
Wait!@Don't forget about that rude person!@She must be hiding somewhere!
......
It's okay.@She's no longer here.
That's great!@It really is Miru...
Erina...
It's been so long. Why does it feel like...@you don't really want to see me?
Of course I do! I'm glad to see you.@Why did you say that?
You're lying.@You haven't taken a step towards me.@Why?
Erina, can you sense it too?
The atmosphere around her shows that@she's obviously being possessed by something...
The bunny phenomenon has appeared as well.@Did that other girl do this?@But why? Why go through all the trouble?
......
Everyone says Erina only likes Rumi and Miru is@not important at all. It's true, isn't it?
No! I used to think of Master all the time,@but Miru... Miru is also...@Miru is also an important master!
Erina! Don't go over there!@We don't even know if she's the real Miru!
......
Enough!
M-Miru...?
I told you to stay away, fairy.@You're such a nuisance!
So you finally revealed yourself!@How dare you use someone else's body.@You won't deceive Ribbon!
You keep messing up my conversations with Erina!@Begone!
...?!

93
R-Ribbon!
Why did you do that?@You've gone too far!
And now you're on guard...@It's this annoying fairy's fault@and she should be punished for being a nuisance!
...!
You're next!@Don't blame me. I hadn't planned on doing@that to the fairy, but she left me no choice!

110
This body is powerfully magical,@but I just can't seem to use it properly!@How annoying!

111
...!
So you're a bunny too...@But who are you and why are you doing this?!
Hehe, Noah will soon become the next Erina!
You know, Noah can be kind of silly too.@It took four tries before Noah sent you in at@the right time.
The small mistake just now wasn't part of the plan,@but it doesn't matter anymore.@As long as you're here, nothing has changed.
Plan? What do you mean?@What's the meaning of all this?
And why are you doing these kinds of things to@Miru and Ribbon...?
Do you still think you came here@because of everyone's magic?
Channeling magic? Activating the Stele?@Sorry, but I had already drained it of magic.
You could never have been sent here@if I didn't want you to.
Ms. Noah...
Do you like the bunny phenomenon@happening on the island?@Noah took care of designing that piece of magic.
Everybody will love bunnies just like in the past!




112
Don't... Don't go!@Where are you taking Miru?!
Hehe, relax. Noah still has need of you!@It just feels a bit cramped in here.
Noah needs time to recover the mana she lost earlier!
......
So if you want this girl, come and take her yourself!


113
......
...
Mmmph...
Ribbon, thank heavens!@You woke up! I-I thought...
...?
E-Erina?@What happened?
Wait!@Didn't we find Miru?@What happened after that?!

114
So we have to follow her?@This feels kind of dangerous...
She's able to use magic to affect Rabi Rabi Island...@Erina, Ribbon hasn't seen magic this powerful before.
Is this about the bunny phenomenon?
Yes.@Let's go, she took Miru.@We can't go back without her.
Hmm...@Looks like we don't have a choice.

//VS NOAH1
140
...!
Another weird space?!@Why now?!
No, Ribbon! This one feels different!@This is...

141
In the end, no one really@remembered what happened...
After that event, there were almost no rabbits@left on the island...
But that doesn't matter. I still remember.@And one day, I will remind them...
You've had your chance to live with everyone.@Now it's my turn.
Yes... Once I replace you, this can all end...

142
......
I don't know what happened to Ms. Noah,@but there must be some other way...
Some other way?@You mean a way to protect yourself?
Sorry... But Noah prefers doing things her way.
...?!@What... What's this magic?!

143
Separate the girl from her precious bunny...@And the negative emotions will come forth...
That should release a great amount of mana...@With this power, I should be able to go back.
Now is the time...@I can finally return...

144
......
......
It was a peaceful place,@but disaster still befell Rabi Rabi Island.
Rabi Rabi recovered, but at a tremendous cost.@The terrible sacrifices were etched into@everyone's memories.
She erased everyone's memories so none of them@would have to carry that burden.@But as a result, she was forced into exile.
At first, she became lonely, then regretful.@As her regret grew, so did her desire@to be back with everyone.
Returning to Rabi Rabi Island wouldn't be easy, so she...

147
Well, what do you mean?!
......
You want to tell us something, right?@Can't we solve this peacefully?
No...
......
Ugh, what am I doing?!@This is no time to get emotional!
My feelings were laid out just like that!@Ahhh! How embarrassing...
...But don't get distracted!@That was just a diversion!

45500
......
This wasn't part of the plan.@Why are you still resisting?
......
I really want to see everyone again...@Has my future already been decided?
All of the mana I gathered, all the time I spent...@It's all going to waste...
......
No, if I can't go back...

45501
...!
Whaa...?@She looks just like Erina!
......
Ms. Noah...
Be careful! She may look different now,@but she hasn't given up yet!

Ms. Noah!
Stop! The space around Noah...@Ribbon thinks it's disappearing!
But...
......
I've used up all my mana,@but I couldn't defeat you.
Ms. Noah, I know you're not a bad person!@I can feel it! You're actually...
No... For the sake of Rabi Rabi Island,@it's better if you go back instead.
......
There's so much to explain...@But I'm out of time.@Did I make the wrong choice?
You're Ribbon... I'm sorry about earlier.
Please take this girl back.@This space will collapse as soon as I go.
Why are you being nice to us now?!@Ribbon doesn't know how to respond...
Ribbon! What do I...@Ms. Noah is disappearing!

These are so cute! Miru, did you buy these?@I've never seen them before!
No, Rumi bought them for me earlier...@In the past, Miru only wanted to be at home with Erina,@so pajamas were fine...
Erina is different now so Miru wants to go everywhere@with Erina!
Hehe... Me too!@Miru actually wanting to go outside!@I'm already excited!

45001
M-Master... Are you done changing?@Ribbon is ready!
Don't call me that, Ribbon.@I'm not used to it yet...
But...
Ribbon looks different!@You have such pretty hair!@You look a bit bigger too.
Ribbon's just wearing more fabric.@She hasn't grown at all...

45002
Ribbon is supposed to be good at tying pigtails,@but Master's hair is so heavy!@This isn't easy!
Miru should be able to help...@Miru helped Saya once when she stopped by.
Saya? I don't think we've met her.@Is she your friend?
Miru isn't sure...@Can Erina sit here?@It's a better height for Miru to work with.

45003

......
......
Done. How's that?
This hairstyle...@Ribbon didn't know it'd be such a big change!
It's quite different. Cuter, perhaps!
It'll be even cuter after a change of clothes.@Time to get the clothes out of the wardrobe.
Hmm... I suppose...
Hehe, Looks like you have to change after all, Master.
So this is the expensive outfit...@It sure looks very un...
...usual.

Have you seen this outfit before, Ribbon?

I... I must be mistaken.@Right, Ribbon?
Umm...
...?

//OUTSIDE RUMI HOME

Thank you for remembering me.@I thought people would forget about me...
Sorry, we need your help this time too.@You only appear whenever I need help...@This is embarrassing...
I didn't forget you this time, Saya.@Is there something different about you?
Different? Maybe...
I was afraid you'd take it to heart,@so I never told you directly...
So learning other magic types does solve your problem.@Why do you have to suffer in addition@to learning unpopular magic?
It's all okay.@I just never noticed.
So is Saya studying other types of magic now?@What a big change!
If she masters ice magic, she can work with me.@One more person will make it a lot easier.
Work... with you, Rita?!@Are you serious?
It was just an idea...@I didn't think you'd be so opposed to it...
I-I'm not opposed to it!@I'd love to work together with you!

45011
Master! Get changed already!@Stop dragging your feet!
I told you to stop calling me that!@I'm still getting used to it.
Oh? They're coming...
I'll leave the rest to you, Saya.@Thank you so much for helping.
I'll just stay and watch you paint.@I've always wanted to see your wonderful technique.@I won't be missing out this time.
You're too kind... @I only started drawing because I didn't@have a lot of friends to play with.

Master Rumi! We're ready! Can we start?
Ribbon, I'm not your master!@Erina is more qualified for that position!
Darn it! Rumi says Erina is better,@but Erina says to not call her Master.@Did Ribbon even find a master?
Why are you looking for a master? We're a family.@It seems so unnecessary...
Unless Ribbon has a master,@Ribbon must return to the forest...
This again, Ribbon? Like I told you,@I am your family, friend, and master.@Just use whatever you used to call me.
Okay, Ribbon understands...
...use what Ribbon used to call her...
It's the same with you, Erina.@Didn't I tell you not to call me Master?@I'd rather have a little sister.
This... This isn't the same!@It doesn't work that way!
So big sister doesn't like Miru anymore...@Maybe Erina can be Miru's big sister.
No, that's not what I...@Why does everyone want to change titles?
Are you ready or not?@Saya is feeling ignored again.
We're ready! Sorry to keep you waiting!
I'll start painting then.@It might take a while, so bear with me.

You're really helpless!@Don't pout!@Wasn't everybody in on this?

//FOREST WITH RUMI/RITA/ASHURI
45014
I've checked the next region and it's bad news...@It's gotten more unstable after the fourth try.@We'll have to act fast.
Are we really not telling Erina?@Having the two of them would be useful.
Absolutely not.@I don't think Erina can turn back into a rabbit.@I've decided to treat her as my little sister.
I just want her to be like a normal girl,@so we must not tell her.
Rumi is still Rumi after all.@You can be so stubborn sometimes.
Still, you're right.@After all, we don't know what Noah's goals are.@I know Erina said she's not evil...
Who knows what Noah is capable of?@We might be relying on a bunny and a fairy@to save us all. Can we really@ask them to do this?
That's taking it too far.@Noah's just a bunny who wants everyone@to like bunnies.
But why bunnies?@And how did Erina and Miru even@end up over there?
The more I think about it, the more I feel@like something bigger is involved.
So Noah's from here because she wanted to return...@How could we have forgotten the time when@bunnies existed? What does she want people@to remember?
......
That's all in the past, though.@What we need to worry about@is the Stele's effects right now.
True. We were lucky no one saw it last time.@If these illusions appear again during the day,@the secret will be out!
Let's make up our minds.@I think Rita and I should head in first.@Then we'll switch if we need to.
No, Saya and I will go too. We should move as a group.@Saya's magic is strong, and it'll be useful@to have telepathy.
I agree.@You said the volcano is really unstable, Ashuri.@We'll need all hands on deck if something happens.
That makes sense, we'll take four people then.@Same as before.
......
The bunny catchers are showing up.@We should continue this discussion later.
Why are they out so early?@We're done, right?@We just need to carry out the plan.
Let's meet again tomorrow morning.@We should be able to sort it out by then.

Master left early again today.@Did you see Master leave, Ribbon?
......@Does Ribbon really need to wake up at this time...?

46001
Hmm... This has been happening a lot.@Is there something she's not telling us?
Does Miru know where she went?@We should ask her.
I don't think Miru would know.@She's still sleeping and hates being woken up.
What about Miriam?@Or Master's other friends?@Let's go ask them.

//POST GAME VISIT SHOP
46002
Ms. Cocoa? Why are you here?
There's no need to add a Miss in front of my name.@Can't you be less... formal?
Never mind that, what are you doing here?@Where's Miriam?
Oh, she's just worried about Rumi's investigation,@so I'm taking care of the store for her.
Investigation?@Master never told us about an investigation.
Uhh, i-it's not really an investigation!@Sh-She just has some personal matters to take care of!
Really?
......
......
Alright, alright! I'll talk!@I'm beginning to get worried too...
To stop the side-effects of the Stele,@they went to the Volcanic Caverns under the beach...
...!
Hey, wait!@You're not going there now, are you?!

46003
Why does Rumi always treat us like children?!@How could she not tell us anything?
Let's get going.@These side effects don't sound good...
The Volcanic Caverns are under the beach.@We need to use the Warp Stone to get as close as we can!

//POST GAME FOUND RITA AND SAYA
46005
Rita! Are you okay?!@Do you want to rest for a bit? This looks bad...
I'm... I'm alright! Don't mind me.@Rumi and Miriam are more important! Keep going!

46006
Rita!@You look injured!@What happened?!
Erina?!@Why are you here?!
It's really dangerous!@Get out of here now!
Why didn't you tell us anything?
Yeah, Cocoa said Rumi came down here.@If Rita is here, you must know about@the side effects too.
Cocoa told you?@She really can't keep a secret...
Can we do this later? Rita is hurt right now.
Sorry...@but we're really worried.
Saya... I'm in no shape to continue,@and I can't keep my promise with@that idiot Rumi now...
Promise?@What could Master be up to?
......
Rumi wanted you to live like a normal girl@ever since you brought Miru back.
But a normal girl wears normal clothing,@doesn't only eat carrots,@and doesn't wave a hammer around!
That's true...
It can't be helped.@Erina was a bunny to start with.
But I agree with Rumi.@You're the only bunny here.@We can't expose you to more danger.
The Stele draws its mana from under the island.@Using the Stele results in instability down here.
It's happened several times already.@Hostile illusions appeared in Rabi Rabi Town.@Luckily, the disturbances all happened at night.
So, how are things now?
...And where's Master?
We've fixed the problem by sealing this place up.@But...
On our way back, an earthquake struck.@So only three of us managed to get out.
Rita was injured, so I'm taking care of her now.@Ashuri went back to investigate.
We weren't expecting Miriam though.@There were only supposed to be four of us,@but Miriam was worried so she came.
She went missing after the quake as well...@Ashuri should be looking for them...

46007
I guess it's up to you two now.
Ashuri is taking an awfully long time.@If you can, check up on her too.
There are also illusions that look like us inside.@Don't be fooled!
I'm very sorry I can't be of any assistance...
Don't worry.@Leave Master, Ashuri, and Miriam to us.@Ready, Ribbon?
Right!@Is it this way?@Let's hurry!
Do take care...@Come back safe and sound!

//VS MIRIAM

You're here.
Miriam!@We found you at last!
Since my plan was stopped,@some changes are in order.
...? What do you mean, Miriam?
I'm here to remind you of something.@Have you forgotten who I am?
This voice... Noah?
Correct, thank you for trying to save me@and giving me the chance to return here...
It's unfortunate, but I've lost even my rotten body.@I can only talk through non-magic users now,@which is why I guided this girl here.
......
......
I gave you your human form so that I could use it@to return to Rabi Rabi Island.@I once had those rare bunny ears you have.
But you defeated me.@This means Rabi Rabi Island doesn't@need my protection anymore.
I'm sorry I got your Master's sister involved.@Her magic power would have let me replace you.
Interestingly, both your appearance and personality@strongly resemble my past self.
Since I can't go back now,@you'll need to be the one who protects Rabi Rabi.@I trust you'll do a good job.
That's impossible! Erina is Erina!@She would never do the terrible things you did!
Although I do look like her...@and Ms. Noah did give me this form...
Good... I have so much more to explain.@There's no time, so I'll be brief.
My wish is to stop the outside world@from finding this island again.
If it happens again, please do what I did.@No, i'm sure you'll do it... because you're me.
Sacrifice yourself, make everyone forget everything,@including your own existence.
Don't regret it.@I tried to return, but my need for mana@caused all the bunnies to disappear.
Outside world? I don't...
...Ribbon won't believe it!@Erina wouldn't hurt people like you did.
Hurt people... Perhaps that was a cruel choice.@If it ever happens again, you'll understand.
I want everyone to live in peace.@That's also why I wanted to come back...@To keep watch over this island.
If you accept this responsibility, I can leave in peace.
Finally, say sorry to this girl here for me.@She is being heavily influenced by this place.@Please wake her up...
That's it. My mana is almost spent.@Goodbye.
......
I don't fully understand,@but I'll try to remember... what you said.
We have no idea if she's telling the truth, but...
Now's not the time to think about this.@The surrounding magic has gotten to Miriam!
Looks like it's not over yet...

47001
......
Erina? Ribbon?@What happened?
Wonderful! Miriam is okay!
The magic here has stabilized too.@This place is safe now!
But where are Rumi and Ashuri?
Did something happen?@I had just heard from Rumi that@they encountered trouble under the volcano.
I was going to look for help,@but after reaching the Warp Stone...@I don't remember anything after that.
That means...@Maybe what Ms. Noah said was true.
Maybe parts of it...@but we can't trust her yet!


47002
M-Miriam!@Erina and Ribbon?!@Are you here? So you found out anyway...
Ms. Ashuri!@You're alright!
I came here to rescue people.@Why are people worrying about me instead?
Right... Miriam! What were you doing?@You teleported me away!@When did you learn magic?
I... I don't remember anything...@Did I do something bad?
The magic here was getting to Miriam,@but she's alright now!
Oh, you've cleared this place up!@We should've asked for your help,@but Rumi wouldn't stand for it.
Oh, yes... Rumi. She might still be in danger!@She told me she warped to the Forgotten Cave.
No wonder... The Forgotten Cave?@I don't remember it being very dangerous.@But if you go too deep, there might be some@unpleasant side effects.
I will go there at once!@I will find Master!
You and Ribbon? I guess you can...@Miriam looks tired, so I'll take her back to town.@I'll hurry back soon!
Let's not waste time. We'll leave right now.@You should get going too!

47003
The Forgotten Cave...@It's the cave under the Starting Forest.@Let's go then.
Yes, let's!

//ENTER

There are images of many strange places here.@Are they all from that world?
None of us ever imagined there were places@beyond these islands...
Master! We're here.@Let's go home now.
But the Stele... It's a complete mystery to us.@What does it all mean?
......
Ribbon thinks she's acting funny.@Normally Rumi would've rushed over to hug you.
Master, let's not worry about those now.@It might be dangerous to stay here.
She seems a lot like Miriam before.@Can it be Noah again?
I believe what Ms. Noah said was true@so she's already gone.
I think Master's just being affected by the magic...
Erina, Ribbon... You've been out there, right?@Don't you want to know more?
Master, Miru is back.@We don't want to think about it anymore...
Ribbon thinks it's the same issue.@We need to wake Rumi up!

//AFTER
48003
N-No way!@Not even with my Cocoa Bombs...

48004
Why didn't Rumi tell me about this?@What should we do now?
What happened here?@I said I'd come back to help,@so why is the entrance sealed?
There are so many of us here.@Can't we do anything?
Do you know how long they've been in there?@It feels like a long time...
If they came here after I left with Miriam,@then it's been over two hours.@That's quite a while...

It's wonderful though!@They're safe, and the stele is under control!
We weren't of any help either... Erina did everything.@One of these days, she'll be like that bunny@who once protected us all.
What bunny are you talking about, Pandora?

Is my memory finally going to bits@after living for so long?

I still retained some faint memories from the cave@even though I was under the influence of it's magic.
What I saw really left an impression.@The Stele, the outside world, and Noah...@They all feel connected.

Erina feels the same way.@The things Ms. Noah said...@They bother me too.
If what Ms. Noah said is true,@then maybe I'm not me any more?@Instead...

Oh, I see!@Does everyone here recognize my genius now?@Go ahead and ask away!
Master, keep yourself under control!@Don't substitute real life with your fantasies...

48013
We've heard from Rumi about her experiences,@and we've started asking some questions...
Erina, you've heard us mention the beach,@the seaside, and other related places, right?
Yes, Ashuri once said something about going to the@beach while we were looking for the crystal.
We've been maintaining the invisible barriers around@Rabi Ribi Island but we don't exactly remember why@this is such an important task.
All we remember is: we can't let in anything from@the outside. I feel like we've forgotten almost@everything else though.
Then she was...
This again?
What? Erina?@Do you know something?
What you just said... @I heard about it from someone else...
Who asked you to keep the barriers up?@And why haven't I heard anything about this?
Sorry, we don't remember either.@We have to do it, but never recalled for whom,@or why.

48014
Wasn't it Erina who told us to do this?
What are you even saying?@We're having a serious discussion here.
No, that idea just flashed through my mind...
......
No, it couldn't possibly have been Erina.@Sorry, it just slipped out.
You should take a couple more years of rest.@You're getting a little crazy already...
Hey Pandora, since you've lived for so long,@you should remember what happened before.
......
What happened before... like bad things, right?@I don't think so.
Whenever I try to recall anything,@I always feel there's a gap in my memory...
......
...So everybody forgot something important.
Erina, Ribbon is starting to connect the dots here...

48015
So Cicini, do you think you're connected@in any way to what we were talking about?
I'm not sure what you want from us...@This outside world could be our world@but otherwise, we dont know anything.
Wait, Syaro! Don't make it sound so trivial!@What if Rabi Rabi Island and our world@are the same?
We thought the stele and Cicini were related to@other universes, but what if you were all instead,@related to the world just outside these islands?
This may need some definitive proof.@Any ideas, Cicini? Syaro?
If we can prove that the outside world is your world,@I think we can relax for now.
Why? Our world isn't really a nice place.
We were warned to stay hidden.@I'm just worried there might be terrible monsters out there.
That might be possible...@If there were monsters that would be really scary!
Don't worry, we'll help you prove it!@Come over here for a moment, Syaro.

48016
......
So about those barriers...
Our signals are disappearing after a few miles.@It should be because of those barriers.@Could you remove them for a short while?
Remove them?@Won't that be dangerous?
Then again, what kind of danger?@I'm having a hard time remembering....
Removing the barriers is doable.@We're just not sure why we were maintaining them.
Did we make some sort of promise?@I can't remember...

48017
We can lift the shield for now.@It shouldn't take long if we split up.
Alright, I'm okay with this plan.@We might even learn something new.
Let's do it.@I've never tried it before.@All we need to do is remove the magic.
Off we go then.@Try the signal thing again in a little while!

48018
Debugging is now complete.@We can get connected now!
Erina and Ribbon, can you go to the Computer Room?@Remember the blue place at the bottom of the lab?
The system again?@Why are we going there?
If you can reach the other side of the System,@that means Rumi's guess was right.
Let's go then.@It'll only take a moment with the Warp Stone!
But...
Wait! I was thinking...@You don't want anyone outside coming here.@But what about the two of us?
If we're really from the outside world,@then we shouldn't be here.
......
You're both here,@but nothing much has happened!
I think the barrier's real job is:@"Don't let anything outside find out@about this place".
......
I see...@This was all supposed to be fun and games,@but I don't think we can go back now.
Even if we don't say anything,@Daddy will no doubt keep asking.
This is a very big decision to make.@Are you really okay with this?
As long as Master is with me@I don't mind whether we go back or not.
Other than Daddy, I don't have any reason@to go back... Syaro was an orphan, and I never@left the house. I don't know anyone else there.
......
Without my dad...@I don't...
Cicini...
Sorry, Master, but we should start.@The barriers can't stay down for too long, right?@We better hurry.
Your destination will be the left end of the System.@It connects to another system!
I must also warn you.@We don't know what the other system is like.
You may have to force your way back.@So think carefully...
Relax!@After all that's happened,@it shouldn't be too bad.
Alright!@The left side of the System, you said?@We'll go over there now!

48019
Is there anything I can help with?
Of course. You know telepathy right? To avoid@being caught, we're not using my inventions.@However, You should be able to get your@messages through.
I understand.@Take care then, Erina and Ribbon...

48026
Not this way! We need to get to the computer!

//BEFORE FALL INTO RED CYBER
48020
Erina... Erina!@Can you hear me?
If you can hear me, could you do@something to let me know?
Master!@We can hear you!@Are we already there?
Erina, that won't work!@We can only use Rumi's telepathy, remember?@They can't hear us talking!
Oh, right!@Do something...

48021
I see it! I can see you jumping in this box!@Can you hear me?@Jump three times for a yes.

48022
Great! The message did get through!
Cicini says the link will only last a few seconds,@so don't waste this opportunity.
See the opening up ahead?@When I count to zero, jump into it!
After you jump, two things may happen.@If you come out, then the link didn't work.@If you don't... then our guess was right.
That's it. Let me remind you again.@This might be dangerous. Please think about it.
If you're ready, can you jump three times?@Remember, a five second countdown and jump at zero!

48023
Looks like you've decided...@I'll start the countdown.@Erina, Ribbon, be careful!
Five...@Four...@Three...
Two...
One...
Zero!@Now!

48024
This... This is...@We didn't go back outside. That means...
Rumi and Cicini were right...
Really...
Ribbon would like to say something...
Ribbon thinks...@Master Erina has changed recently.
Ever since you heard what Noah said,@you've become so serious.
Now that we know about this,@what will Erina do?@Can't we just live a normal life?
Ribbon left the forest because Ribbon wanted@a carefree life. Ribbon knows she's being selfish...
......
Is that how you feel, Ribbon?@I never noticed.
Yes, I've just been so confused recently.@Everything's happening so quickly...
I really appreciate Ribbon telling me all this.
I mean... Well...@Maybe now's not the time to talk about this.@Ribbon is very sorry.
It's okay! We're here to look for answers@because everyone feels uneasy.@It's good to know the mystery is almost solved!
Don't worry, Ribbon.@I don't plan on doing anything extraordinary@because it'll be over soon!
R-Really...?
Trust your master!@Let's hurry back.@Everyone's waiting for us!
Yes! In the end...@Ribbon likes Erina the most when@she's cheerful and sincere!

48025
But we're still going forward...
There's no way back.@Master's telepathy isn't reaching us here either.
Don't worry, we're invincible together!@Let's go this way!
Right!@Let's find the exit!

//VVVVVV
48500
UNABLE TO LOG INTO INTERFACE AS ANONYMOUS.@"WWWWWW" SCANNING SYSTEM ACTIVATED.

48501
...!@Why did I suddenly start floating?!
Watch out, Erina!@Something's flying towards us!

48502
We're safe for now...@That must have been the defense system...
Look, Ribbon! This structure looks like@what Master told us to jump into!
It does! Maybe it's the way back!@Will it be dangerous though?
Without Master or Cicini to guide us,@there's no other way to go.@Looks like we have no choice.
That's true...@Well, let's get going!

48503
......
Erina!@Can you hear me?@You're back now!

48504
Wonderful!
We could see you moving all along,@but my telepathy couldn't reach you.@Sorry...
I can hear Master very clearly now!@I'm glad to be back!
Right! It's finally over!

48505
Master!
Rumi!
Erina... Ribbon... Thank heavens.@You're both back safe and sound.
I'm sorry that in my search for an answer,@I sent you to such a dangerous place@while I could only sit here...
We made it back, Master!@That's what matters!
You were amazing!@You even beat the defense system!
Let's get straight to the point...@Now that we have this information,@what do you plan to do?
......
There isn't anything to worry about!@We thought the outside meant monsters,@or other bizarre things.
Instead, it's that place where people@live peacefully together...@That makes me feel better.
Peacefully...? I'm not so sure about that...@but it's better than monsters.@I thought there would be monsters out there.
Cicini told me about their place,@but it seems kind of complicated.
But Cicini...@You seemed so happy to be talking about it...@It's important to you, isn't it?
......
Haha, Rumi sure picked the right time.@I was just about to mention this to everyone.@First, take a look at this!
A box?@What does it do?
Remember when we first met?@This is what I was studying.
We were studying what Daddy was working on@when we ended up here somehow.
Since we know this is a part of Earth,@this thing is a lot simpler than I thought.
Earth?
You don't know what Earth is?@Our cultures are very different indeed...
If this is the same world, this device and@the Stele both function the same way.
Like the Warp Stones here, all they do is@simple teleportation.
This device was built specifically to travel here,@so my guess is there are people who already know@about this island.
You mean...@People outside now know about Rabi Rabi?
They knew a long time ago!@Didn't Erina say this had happened before?
Yes, that's what Ms. Noah said...
Then if you hadn't stolen this box,@something unpleasant might've happened!
That's very likely. If Daddy had found this place...@He would have told the world, because@that's what scientists do.
So, by stealing this box, we did you all@a great favor! How will you repay us?
Don't listen to Master.@This box may be here, but they might make@another one.
Do you understand now?@We are in a dangerous situation here...
So what can we do?@It's hard to prevent people from warping here.
If that does actually happen...@Ms. Noah said I will deal with it.
E-Erina...?!@You can't mean...
What are you talking about, Erina?@You can't fix something like this with a hammer!
Don't worry! We can fight science with science!@I know this box inside and out now.@I can separate the two sides forever!
Forever?@But then you won't be able to go back...
......
......
Hey! Why are you all looking at me like that?!@Don't underestimate me!@I've already made my decision!
I've thought long and hard about this.@If we go back, they'll ask us about here.@I don't want that.
If I go back, I might not be able to stop Daddy!@I don't want to see you in the news@and on the internet!@It would ruin Rabi Rabi Island!
I don't want to ruin this place@for the sake of discovery and curiosity.@I want it to remain peaceful...
It's not just about going back to Daddy...@I'm not a stubborn child any more...@I've made the best choice I can for everyone.
Please, let us stay here and live with all of you...

//Final Chapter
49000
W-Wait! Since when could you fly so fast?!@That's almost cheating!
Hehe, Ribbon isn't the slowest one anymore!@Lilli, Pixie! You can't escape me now!
Yikes! Ribbon is so scary!

49001
Those fairies... They're playing games again!
The painting equipment is a little heavy for them...
Not at all. I think they just don't want to paint.
We've been lazy too.@Spending the whole day painting...
We don't have to go the beach everyday now,@so this should be normal. It's far more productive@than sleeping twelve hours a day.
What? If I hadn't come to your house,@you'd still be piled up like snow on your bed!
A sleeping Rita!@I'd love to see that...
Let's not talk about that...@I think I've overslept though.@I feel dizzy...

49002
Ribbon!@There's more behind us!
More people looking for bunnies!
Here again?@Ribbon won't let you get close to Master!

49003
Hah! They got scared. How boring...
Even though it's all over,@some annoying bunny lovers are still around.
Haha, I'm used to it.@They aren't all that dangerous, so it's not a big deal.
Not dangerous? Erina is still so naive.

49004
We should really tell Erina...@Why shouldn't she know the truth?
I think so too. This might be best for everyone.
What are you talking about?@It would be pointless if we said it.
The three of us overheard it accidentally too.@We promised Kotri we wouldn't tell.

49005
Oh! I haven't been here with Rumi for a while.@A lot of people are gathered here.
It's the kitty sisters and Master!
It's beautiful here. Vanilla wanted to come again...
We need to talk to Erina about something,@so I came along.
Can you show them around, Ribbon?@I need to talk to Erina.
Oh, so it has nothing to do with Ribbon.@Sure.
Want to play with us fairies?@There's a long bridge this way.@Have you seen it before?
I don't think we saw it last time.@Let's go take a look!
Such a small fairy.@Looks quite tasty too...

49006
So...@Did you need something, Master?
Actually, it's Irisu who's looking for you.@That doesn't happen often,@so I came to tell you right away.
Really? Ms. Irisu?! Where is she now?
Erina really does like Irisu...@You're so happy to hear her name.
Kotri said they'll be coming over together.@They should be almost here.
......
Oh...? Are they already here?

49007
Irisu! Didn't you say you were ready?@What are you standing there for?

49008
You came here too, Ms. Irisu?@Thank you for the delicious chocolates.
R-Really? Don't mention it.@I'm glad you liked them...
......
Please don't just run off again, Ms. Irisu.@We never get to chat together.
Did Erina offend you somehow?@When I was a bunny, Irisu played with me a lot.
You still remember those times?@That makes me really happy.
Remember in the forest when you said we'd meet again?@Well, I have things@I've been wanting to say to you.@If you have time, can we meet privately?
Yes, I remember!@Yay, I can finally be with Ms. Irisu now!
D-Don't say it like that!@You're making me blush...
Please... look at this.@If this works for you,@let's meet here on the map tomorrow.
That's all. Please come by yourself...@and please don't tell anyone....

49009
Oh... so it's not now?@Why did she leave again?
Looks like I'll have to find her again.@I thought I could kick back and relax.@Let's meet up some other time.

49010
Was that Irisu and Kotri?@What's the hurry?
What did Irisu give you?@Can we take a look?
Hehe... It looks like a secret.@Come on, let me take a good look~
No I can't!@Why are Rita and Saya looking at me like that too?

//NEXTDAY @ RABIRABI FOREST
49011
If I get up this early, even Master@won't know I came here!
I finally get to talk with Ms. Irisu.@I feel kind of nervous...

Ms. Irisu? Are you here?

Sure!@I'm coming in now.

//ENTER IRISU'S ROOM
49014
Wow! Is this Ms. Irisu's room?
Yes. It's a little messy.@Sorry about that...
Not at all. It's actually very tidy!@But...
It looks a lot like our home!
I-It's nothing...@I just thought that if Erina were to live here,@it would feel more familiar...
Was it designed for me?@That makes me really happy!
Why do you live here, Ms. Irisu?@There are all these bunny girls here...
......
What... What is it... Ms. Irisu...?
Do you really want to know?
Actually...
Actually, I...

//NOT LAST CG
49015
E-Erina, I...
It's all my fault. I caused so much trouble...@for you and for everyone else...
Why do you say that?@You haven't done anything bad, Ms. Irisu.
I really like bunnies.@I really envy Rumi.
I used to come and play with you everyday.@I thought I would be content with that...
But...
The urge to own a bunny kept growing.
......
That day in the forest@when I realized you were a bunny...@I-I actually really wanted to...
Why didn't you say so earlier, Ms. Irisu?@I thought you didn't like me.
No, it's not like that. I avoided you because@I was afraid you'd hate me...@Now I really regret it.
The bunny hunting group appeared because of me.
Eh?
I just wanted help with finding bunnies,@but our numbers kept growing.@Now it's out of control.
I'm very, very sorry!@It's... It's my fault for putting you in danger@and making a mess of Rabi Rabi Island.
I'm so sorry.
......
So that's what you wanted to say.@Thank you for telling me, Ms. Irisu!
This room really feels like home!@I'd love to visit Ms. Irisu more often!
Because, no matter what happens,@Erina likes Ms. Irisu a lot too!
......

49333
Wow! This bed is big enough for several people!@If Ms. Irisu doesn't mind...
Erina! No!@We... You can't!
...?!
S-Sorry for getting on the bed.@I'll get off right away...
Arrgh...@This is all Erina's fault.@Why? Why... Erina, on my bed...
No, I was just curious.
W-Wait! Hold on! It-It's still early and Erina doesn't@want to sleep yet!

Sorry...
But... My body is moving on its own!

It's fine now.@They're sleeping it off.

Hey, Rumi! They look fine now, don't they?
A girl's romance is really a fickle thing.@Look at what happened with this one.@I hope they'll get along...
So, Rumi, when did you give up on Erina?@Look at your little sister, and now Irisu...
Both of them flipped the world upside-down,@partly because of Erina...@I'm starting to think of Erina as a dangerous girl!
That's not funny.@If I let Erina meet more people like you,@she'll start becoming naughty.
So you're going to monopolize her now?
So as Erina's master, how do you feel about@the two of them getting together?
G-Getting together? ...Erina just respects Irisu.@They've known each other for a while!
See? Uncertainty! Your master status is in jeopardy!@So, you do feel jealous after all.
Oh come on, stop teasing me.@You should hurry to Cicini.@Don't you have that thing@the two of you do every month?

Miru doesn't talk after all...
You don't have to be a tree though.@They wouldn't know how to react.
That's good.
Sis... Why can that girl sleep with Erina?
It's just temporary. Sleep with me for now?
But Erina's better...
......
Boohoo... Erina...@How can I make my little sister like me?

49033
......
So people have forgotten about Ribbon.@Darn...
Oh! You're up, Ribbon.@Are you still tired?
I haven't thanked you properly yet.@Ribbon helped us a great deal.
There's really no need.@Ribbon was just joking about being forgotten.@With freedom and a master... Ribbon is content!
......
And why is Irisu sleeping with Master?
Don't you remember, Ribbon?@You told us they fell asleep in the forest!
Of course Ribbon knows that! But...@Irisu seems to be afraid of Erina.@She's bound to have some kind of reaction.
That's the moment I'm waiting for!@We'll just have to wait and see!
But why?
Hehe, her reaction will be awesome!@After seeing what happened in the forest,@I just know this will be interesting.
Mmmph...
Haha, Miru is jealous.

49044
......
Hmm...
Miru, Ribbon, have you ever seen Irisu@take off her headdress?
No, not interested...
Neither has Ribbon.@We never see Irisu for long.
Should we take it off her, then?
Do you want to wear it?
N-No, it just looks uncomfortable to sleep in.
Great, you won't fight me for it then.@Let me try it on.
You really are sisters.@You even think the same!

Oh, you're just in time.@Could the two of you come here, please?

49503
Hmm? Wait...@You aren't from around here, are you?
Hello, Ms. Octopus!@What is this place?
Ms. Octopus?@There's no need to be so formal.@Just call me Mr. Tako.
This is Plurkwood.@A place for blogs and information!@By the way, I'm a guy.
Ribbon doesn't really understand, but it sounds cool!@Can we look around?
I guess so, but watch out@for the local creatures.@They're very territorial!
Understood!@We'll be careful!
Oh, and while you look around,@could you help me find my pet?
We ran a search already,@but we couldn't find it.@Where could it be?
What's your pet?@Is it like a cat?
No, it's a Meaty Bone!@It looks like a walking, bone-in piece of meat.
Meat?@Was it that creature we saw earlier?
There are many Meaty Bones here but mine@has an octopus mark on its back!
Oh yes, if you run into Keke Bunny,ask her too.@She should be a bit deeper in the woods.
She has a white cape, sharp teeth, and@an annoying laugh. And also she eats a lot!
Keke?@Okay, we'll try and find it while we@look around this amazing place!
Here we go into the unknown!
Good luck! I will be very grateful if you find it.@Thank you so much.

//VS PLURK DOUBLE CAT
49504
Look, cats!@They look pretty typical.
Typical?@Erina, you don't find these cats... unsettling?
What are you talking about, Ribbon?@They're cute kitties.
You've been calling the creatures here cute.@Is this just a difference in taste?
But compared to those bodiless head-kitties,@these are relatively normal.
Hey, don't put it like that, Ribbon.@Head-kitties sound creepy!

49505
We must have intruded upon their territory.@Take care, Erina.
These feel more dangerous than before.@Cute does equal danger!
Really? So Ribbon is the most dangerous?@In that case: Here, kitty kitty!

Tasty?@You can't eat everything you see, Ms. Bunny.
Eh? Bunny?
Oh! Ms. Cape is a bunny!@Finally, another bunny.@I'm so glad!
What's there to be excited about?
So you're a bunny too.@I can't eat you then.@Booooring!
We're trying to find someone's Meaty Bone.@Ms. Bunny... did you eat it?
Hehehe... Impossible!@Wild Meaty Bones taste the best!@Pet Meaty Bones don't have any flavor!
This bunny really likes to eat.@It's all she talks about.
Hmm? What's this little critter?
My name's Ribbon!@It's rude to call Ribbon a critter.
Hehehe... It looks rather tasty.
Wait, what are you doing, Ms. Bunny?!@Ribbon is my friend! She's not food!
But it looks quite tasty.@How about you let Keke Bunny take a lick?
Absolutely not!@Please stop, Ms. Bunny!
Come on...@Let Keke Bunny give you a good lick.
E-Erina, We should get out of here...@This bunny is disturbing!
Come on! Let Keke Bunny eat you!
Come on, come on!
Eek! What was that?!@That was dangerous!

Hmm... So I can't eat it?@Why?
......
You fought so hard against Keke Bunny!@Y-You're planning on eating Keke Bunny?!
How did you reach that conclusion?!@You need to stop thinking about food!
Keke Bunny is not tasty!@If you want food, I can give you lots of Meaty Bones!
Haha...@You remind me of Ribbon when we first met.@I don't like meat though.
Let's leave before she acts up again.@This bunny is such a nuisance.
If she didn't eat Mr. Tako's Meaty Bone,@let's keep searching!
That's true.@Goodbye then, Ms. Bunny.@Sorry to have disturbed you.

Why did they run away? What an odd bunny!
Still, I'm saved!@Time to find some food!

//BACK TO PLURK TAKO

You're back!
Sorry, Ms... Mr. Tako.@We haven't found your pet yet.
There's no need to apologize!@I should be the one saying sorry.@It was my mistake.@My Meaty Bone was stuck in the chimney...
It wasn't missing?@That's great!@We meant to wander around anyway.
I wonder if it wants to be eaten.@It was nearly cooked through...
Still, I did ask for your help.@Consider this a token of my gratitude.
Thank you!@Please visit Rabi Rabi Town one day, Mr. Tako!
I definitely will if I have the chance.@Feel free to come out here to play!
And please don't mention this place to anyone.@Outsiders might make the local creatures uneasy.
I see, that's not a problem!@See you later then!
Have you tried searching for Rabi-Ribi on Plurk?@I'll let you use this computer.
I hope this will help you.@See you later.

You mean the cake Master made?@No wonder one went missing...
So it's cake?@Cake is really tasty!
Keke Bunny heard you need help!@Keke Bunny can help,@if you have cake...
We can get cake...@But Erina likes Master's cakes too.
Come on!@I even brought all these Meaty Bones!@All I need is some cake to go with them!
......
Never mind then. I will take a look around!@It looks like there are lots of tasty treats here!
You probably shouldn't!@There are lots of bunny hunters out there!
No way... It's actually dangerous here?@If I can't eat anything or look around,@I should just go back!
Actually, you're the biggest danger here.
Wait! We do need help.

Hey, Erina?@I've been wondering about a few things...
How come only the main characters move around@while the others just walk through town?@Can't they be more helpful?
Umm, Ms. Cocoa.@I don't really understand what you're saying...
I just want to help you more!@How about you buy this? It will definitely help you.
You just press here, and "BOOM"!@Everything's gone!
Just 6000 en each. It's a steal!@Wanna buy one?

50002
Thank you so much!@Now I won't have to beg Rumi for dinner tonight!
Here you go.@You can use it from the Item menu!

50003
Oh, you're not interested.
Well, come back if you change your mind!

50011
Oh, it's you! Why do you look so nervous?
Hey! Do you have 1000 en?@If you do, I can charge this up for you.
What does it do, you ask?@It lets you move faster on the ground@so you can explore faster!@Handy, isn't it?

50012
Alright! That looks good enough!@Keep up the good work!

50013
Oh, you don't need it?@If you do, just let me know!

50021
Erina.. I was thinking...@We don't have to try and go back.@It's not that bad here.
Here's my cell phone.@I added a Find Item function to it.
It might be useful to you.@If you provide 5000 en to charge it,@the phone should run for some time.

50022
Right! It's ready to go!
The phone is yours now.@If we ever do leave one day...@I hope you won't forget about us.

50023
Oh, you have other things to buy?@Don't worry, come back when you're ready!

50031
Hmm... I'd love to try being your size, Ribbon.@Would you like to try it out, Erina?
I know some size-changing magic.@Give me 1250 en, and I can try it on you.
What, you think this is an unfair deal?@It's not like I'm forcing you!

50032
It worked! Good... I'll try it myself later.

50033
Aww... Why do you reject all my research.

50041
Hey, can you see me?
I've been studying magic to be more noticeable but@I haven't actually tried anything yet.
Can you pay me 1000 en to try it on you?@The effects wear off after you leave town though...
Wh-What kind of offer is that?!@That's not right!

50042
Are you sure you want this?@I'm not doing anything strange, am I?

50043
You're right, it's unfair.@But at least you noticed me...

50051
It's Erina and Ribbon!@I hear you're making good progress!
Rumi made your lucky charm, right?@It's handy, but takes a long time to recharge.
Rumi gave me a charm too!@I found a way to make it more practical!
If you have 2000 en,@I can help you!

50052
Okay, it's done!@I hope this will be of use to you!

50053
You don't need it yet?@Well, find me when you're ready.

50061
Erina! Ribbon! How are things?
You know, every time I see you, Erina,@you always look so frail.
But don't worry!@I actually know a spell that can maximize your health!
Casting the magic costs 2000 en.@I really think this will work!

50062
That's done then!@Do you feel more energized?

50063
Okay, take care then.@You know, I'm still worried about you...

50071
I heard fairies use a lot of mana to move around.@When Ribbon runs out of magic,@it gets difficult for Erina too, right?
I actually know a spell that can maximize your usage,@and will make things easier for you.
Casting the magic costs 2000 en...@I think you'll like it!

50072
That's done then.@Do you feel a lot more energetic...?

50073
Oh... So you don't need it...

50081
Erina?@You look injured!
Did you get hurt during your search?@Don't be too hard on yourself.@It might slow you down instead.
By the way, I know healing magic!@But I'm low on mana while I'm outside the forest.
If you give me 2000 en,@I can try casting this spell on you.

50082
There, now you have automatic healing!@Good luck!

50083
Okay, well, do take care...@I don't want to see you hurting again...

50091
When will you have time to play with me?
I know what you're doing is important.
But can you hurry up?@How about I give you some extra mana, little fairy?@That should make things go more smoothly.

50092
Good, it will cost 2000 en!@I didn't say it would be free!

50093
That's fine.@Just sort things out soon,@I can't stand waiting any longer!

50101
Hmm... So the quality of singing relies on a factor called...@charisma, right?
In order to increase my charisma above water,@I've been practicing a lot!
Hey! Do you want me to raise your charisma?@I learned this attack-boosting magic to improve my singing.
If you give me 3750 en,@I'll have enough mana to cast the spell.@Want to try it out?

50102
Good, it's ready now.@This will definitely help you!
This will also improve your singing!@Try it out!

50103
You don't need it? What a surprise.@I thought you'd really need it...

50111
Wait, Erina. Should you be walking around in that?@I know less cloth means stronger armor, but...
An extra layer of protection is always handy!@I know some magic that can protect you@even when you're wearing very little!
It should boost your defense.@If you have 2500 en, I'll cast it for you.@It's very useful!

50112
This should keep you safe for a while.@Remember, the effect will expire after a bit.

50113
Hmm, I think you should just change your clothes...

50121
Can I help you in any way?
Huh? A way to weaken the enemy's defense?@Of course!
Apart from strengthening your own defense,@there are also debuffs for your enemies' defenses!
But it's really hot here so I don't have enough mana.@But if you have 2500 en,@I'll put this effect on you!

50122
That's done then!@I hope it helps!

50123
Really?@I thought it was a good idea...

50131
I want to do more@now that I've seen you work so hard.
Huh? A way to weaken enemy's attacks...?@Sure!
Apart from strengthening your own attacks,@there are also debuffs for enemy attacks!
But I'm really hungry, and I don't have enough mana.@But if you have 2500 en,@I can cast this magic for you!

50132
Yes, this will do.@I hope it helps you...

50133
Is that so?@I'd really love to help you though...

50151
I can't believe I'm living outside the pyramid.
Hm? A way to slow down enemies? I know!
The inscriptions in the pyramid contain@many ancient uses of magic.@This is an easy task!
If you have 1500 en,@I can enhance your attacks with it!

50152
Remember, this is the blessing of a princess!

50153
Oh, okay.@Bit of a pity...

50161
Everyone's welcoming Miru back with presents...

Sis explained it to me but I'm not sure what to do.@I'm just going to follow everyone's example.
This place isn't that hot after all.@I think I can find more people to play with us.
Thank you so much...@Without you, we'd be just silly kids.@Let's play together again some time!
Both my sister and I look forward to your return!

61025
Thank you, I can talk to people normally now.@I didn't expect everyone to be so friendly.
I'm glad they aren't afraid of me,@but they're all so curious about my body...@Does touching my hair count as harassment?
Then again, I don't really mind.@I don't feel lonely anymore.

Oh yes, maybe I should warp over there!@Maybe they'll like me!
No... Don't look at me like that, Ribbon.@I was just joking!
Thank you for bringing me here.@Despite the initial reception, I'll try harder!

61031
The hunting is good in Rabi Rabi Town.@I plan to stay here a little longer.
Haha, I know. Don't look at me like that.@I need to recharge my mana to help you.
Hmmm, another world?@Maybe later. This side's enough for now...

61032
The people here are all so nice.@Vanilla would love to stay.
If helping you means Vanilla can stay here,@I can give you lots of mana.

61033
Sorry for the misunderstanding...@I will reflect on it.
As the big sister, I've always wondered:@Why is my sister more powerful?@I seem unnecessary.
Oh yes, make sure you come back!@This wouldn't be Rabi Rabi without bunnies!

61034
Another world? That might be worthy studying.
It's a pity only one person can go.@Erina will have to serve as a substitute.@Make sure you come back!

61036
Ahh... After all this work.@the Stele finally accepts my magic!
What is it with this Stele.@Does it discriminate against dancing girls?
Haha, I seem to have gone off topic.@Well then, good luck.@I want to see your family reunited soon!

Hehe... You came back! I missed you!@There's actually something I need to tell you!

Basically, New Game+ gives you infinite retries@but starting with all the items and badges you currently have!@You can do it as many times as you want!
With each loop, New Game+ also increases everyone's stats! @For example: HP, attack, level, and bullet speed@will all be increased. Your stats also get a little boost!
And that's everything!@ So... do you want to try it?

86001
Remember, New Game+ is actually harder@than the normal New Game!
For example, New Game+ in Hell difficulty is harder than@a new game in Hell difficulty!
And every New Game+ loop will be harder than the last!

You look very suspicious.@What are you girls doing in a place like this.@And with a s-succubus?
Nothing! W-we're not doing anything!
Calm down, Cicini.@We've already been discovered.@Why don't we just tell them?
Erina, Ribbon, you absolutely can not@tell anybody about this!

51113
Its Erina!
...are you interested in Halloween too?
Uh... Chocolate, Vanilla...@Why are you dressed like that?
That material looks really thin.@Will you two be okay?
You don't have the right to criticize our clothes, Ribbon!
Our clothes were made out of paper anyways...@Magical paper.
Oh okay. but that still doesn't explain@why you're dressed like that.
Because on Halloween,@you dress up as something cute or weird,@go to people's houses, and yell "Trick or Treat"@to get candy!
Yep! That sounds super fun!@I can't wait to tell the others about it!
We've also practiced our "Trick or Treat" routine...@Look, Erina.
Trick or Treat!
W-Wait!@We're here to learn about Halloween, not bullet hell!

51114
Phew... Getting candy isn't easy!@Cicini, does this feel like Halloween?
Yes! Very! I love it!
Then lets go prepare our bags...@Good luck.

51115
Hey...@If they go back dressed like that, people will notice!
I don't think it matters.@Wouldn't it be fun if more people knew?
But a surpise is important too!@We have to catch them!

Eh, is it over already?@Ribbon only understood half of what was going on.
The decorations here are really pretty though!@Do you think we can put one of these@pumpkin lights at home?

Are you still here? Good!@I brought your Halloween clothes!
Ah, it's really too nice of you to...
Don't worry, just take it!@Put it on, and you'll be able to ask for sweets!
If you come to my place,@I'll let you ask for "other services" too!
Uhh... Okay?
E-Erina! Let's ask Cicini for a pumpkin!
We need to catch up with them!
Okay, we have to go now!@Ha-Happy Halloween!

I've heard Rumi talk about it too...@And when she does, she also had that@confused expression on her face too...
Ribbon thinks something's going on...
Should we go check out the Ravine again?@We might discover something new.

//New Todo popup
51529
What's...@Those sound like explosions...
Ribbon, look at what's on this wall...!
......
It's been scratched off..?@But something's carved on here.@I see my name, Irisu and... Rumi.
But I don't think I've been here with them...

//Wall bursts open
51530
Whaa?!
...Vanilla?@What are you doing out here?
Look, it's Erina...@We're playing with Cocoa's Bombs!
She left a ton of bombs up here!@Look, we even found a small passageway!
Wait, I remember those bombs being pretty expensive....
These two mischevious kitties...@Have they been writing names on the walls?
...Maybe?
But the wind here is really strong.@Hey, It's getting kind of dangerous.@You kitties should play somewhere safer.
I know, I know.@It wasn't this strong when we got here,@we were going to leave soon anyways.
Is this Saya's magic...?@Is she using it to stand out more?
Saya...? Oh, right that Saya.@Knowing her, its not unlikely...
But we just saw her going uphill@with Pixie and Lilli!
Huh?@Pixie and Lilli?
Together with Saya...@Why didn't they tell Ribbon...?
I know Ms. Saya wants to be noticed,@but I didn't think she'd do something dangerous!
Well, if they're up there on the mountain...@Did you see them come back down?
We haven't seen them@and this is the only way down.
Hmm, there's something weird about this...@Ribbon wants to go look for them.
Are you really going? But the wind...
Well... Ribbon wants to go so I'll go too.
Oh, when you get back, can you go to Master and@tell her that we're up here?
Sure, and please stay safe...

51531
Can they really tell us to stay safe while@they fly around in those things?
Ribbon, are you sure they're still out there?
There's definitely magic from up there...@But why is Ribbon detecting four sources of magic?
Are there four people up there?
Not sure, but something seems fishy!@We should go investigate!

51532
It's Ms. Saya!
We immmediately noticed you there!@That's a first!
Erina and Ribbon? Thank goodness!@Could you two help me with something?
What happened? Didn't Pixie and Lilli@come up here with you?
You weren't messing around with magic@just to increase your presence, were you?
No, I-I wasn't!@Pixie and Lilli wanted to learn magic from me.@I warned them that if they learned wind magic,@their presence might disappear just like mine did.
But they kept asking and that made me really happy.@So in the end, I agreed to teach them.
I thought this ravine would be a good place to practice@but for some reason, I lost control of my magic...
Ah! There's no time to explain...@It's going to fall completely out of my control...@I don't know what's going to happen!
Uh, you can't even control your abilities?@Are you sure you know how to use wind magic?
Everyone reacts differently to magic!@Stop being difficult and please help me stop this!

51533
I-it finally stopped... Thank you so much...
Now, I should make sure my students are safe!
I shouldn't inconvenience you any further...@Let me handle the rest!

51534
Ms. Rita?
Erina? Have you seen Saya?
Pixie and Lilli were blown away by the wind@so she ran up that way to catch up with them.
Good thing I was worried...@and do you know anything about this@unusual magical field?
No idea...@Ribbon thought Saya was causing it.
We should probably catch up with them ourselves.@I have a bad feeling about this.

//Saya was fighting the fairies
51535
R-Rita!@Why did you come up here!
I was worried about you!@I'm glad I hurried up here, look at your injuries!
B-but I...

//Rita was fighting the fairies
51536
Pixie! Lilli!@Stop it!
Fairies tend to have trouble resisting magic.@Even the tiniest bit can get them all worked up@and hyperactive.
They've suddenly gotten a lot stronger too.@Saya, this doesn't look like your wind magic...
I-I'm not sure either...!@I didn't know I could have that kind of effect!
Ms. Rita, Ms. Saya!@Are you two okay?
Erina?@Why did you two come up here?
They haven't turned evil or anything...@but we don't know what they're capable of @under that kind of magical influence.
What do we do...@Your ice magic doesn't seem to be slowing them down...
Leave it to Ribbon!@Ribbon must be the one to stop them!
If this continues, Pixie's and Lilli won't be able@to withstand the magic! As a fairy,@Ribbon understands this better than anyone else!
Then let's help put a stop to this!@We should be able to handle it!
......
I want to help... But under these conditions,@I might be getting in the way...
We'll make a retreat for now...@Just be careful!

51537
Hey, morons! Pixie, Lilli!@What do you think you're doing!
Cool! It's Ribi!@You guys are here too!
Wow...@So this is what knowing magic feels like...
Urgh, not good... They're even talking strangely.@It's like they've switched personalities...
Ribbon, we need to hurry!@Let's stop them before things get more dangerous!
Are we playing a game? Hooray!@We need someone to play with after Rita left...
But what should we play...@Should we try... that?
Has the word "play" completely lost it's meaning?@Watch out, Master!

51538
S-strange...@My body is...
Suddenly feeling... tired...

51539
......
...ugh...
...!@Pixie, you woke up!
...hm?

51540
...R-ribi?
What... where are we?
You two...@Do you remember what you were doing just now?
...?@...what we were doing just now...@My memory is kind of fuzzy...
If I'm not mistaken...@Weren't we learning magic from Saya?
So you can't remember anything after that?@That's okay, at least everyone's fine!
You're really going to spoil them like that, Master.@Just... Just remember to say sorry to@Saya and Rita!
Huh...?

51541
Eh?! An earthquake?
But we're in the sky!@This floating island is going to fall!@Quick, master, lets get to the@mountains below us!

51542
Phew... We made it...
Let's go home.@That wind still feels unstable.
Hmm... It is quite strong...
Hm...? It's Saya! She's over there!@So we were really learning magic, right?

51543
Ah... You made it!
So physical attacks did work better than magic...@Are Pixie and Lilli okay?
We're okay, but for some reason I'm feeling@kind of sleepy.
Wait, Ms. Rita, why are you two still here?
The wind strength in this area is still rising...@It's getting difficult to use magic and@teleport or fly under these circumstances.@We're just waiting for the wind to...
Hold on... the wind...@I think it's getting stronger!
Let's leave right now!@We should be able to escape these winds@once we go downhill.
Then lets hurry!@We'll be crushed if we stay here!
I still don't know what's happening...@But I agree, we should leave quickly!

//Leave and heading towards warp stone
52000
Erina! Ribbon!@Over here!

52001
Oh no, we're blocked on all sides by boulders...
I hope the warp stone is powerful enough@to get us out of here...
Th-then where should we warp to?
Anywhere! Just do it already!@Anywhere but here!

52002
Brr...It's cold!@Who decided to come here?
Sorry, It was me...@Just... did it out of habit.
Fantastic!@Everyone's safe and sound!
That was close!@There was no way to keep moving and@we were almost flattened!

52003
Um... is it our fault?@Did we get everyone got into this mess...?
I'm starting to remember too...@We just wanted to learn some magic but...
It's not your fault.@There's nothing wrong with wanting to learn magic.@All you wanted to do was catch up with Ribbon, right?
It's my fault for being inexperienced and losing control.@I should have stuck to what I knew...
It's all been resolved so don't worry about it.@I mean, didn't you succeed?
Succeed?
Do you mean...
...
Look!@Is this magic? I think I'm doing magic!
So you managed to retain the magic?
I can do it too! This is wonderful!@Now we can help you, Ribi!

52004
Um...@Erina, we've been wanting to give this to you.
This is...?
If you need anything, just blow into it and@we'll come help you!
Thank you, Pixie, Lilli!@I'll put it to good use!
We're going back to the forest to practice! Bye-bye!

52005
We should get going too.@Saya, can you teach me wind magic?
T-that's not a good idea.@You might disappear!
I'm not worried about that!@And maybe we can work on making sure you don't@lose control of it in the future.
Waaaah!@Rita!
Then... Erina, let's both... try our best!
Yes, we'll try our best!

52006
Uh...@Ribbon isn't going to forget that experience.@Ribbon didn't know her friends could be that scary...
You looked really happy when they said they@wanted to help!
No I wasn't!@It's... It's normal for friends to help each other!
Haha, Ribbon is embarrassed!

//After saving, the fairies appear
52007
Hi, Ribi!
We found a cool new thing!
Lilli, Pixie?@What's happening?
Ever since we could sense magic,@we've been exploring the island again!
When we went near the volcano@we could feel an aura kind of like Erina's!@It was bizzare!
Huh? Me?@Me again?
But it wasn't really like Erina either...
Ahh... I'm just passing this information on!@It's not like I'm curious or anything!

//Fairies Exit
52008
An aura like Erina's...
This feels related to Irisu's picnic memories...
If those kitties weren't responsible for the names@in the ravine, Ribbon thinks there could be@another possibility...
...Noah?
It could be. She's talked about@her memories before...
But Noah is already...
Ribbon believes there might be more@to this whole affair.
Should we go investigate?@We can finally figure everything out from@beginning to end!
Yeah!

53000
It's true... That aura does feel like Erina.
If Noah's really behind this...@Master, what do you plan to do?
Everybody forgot about Ms.Noah.@So I... I still want to do something for her.
I want to...@I want to understand Noah better!
Ribbon wants to understand her too!@Let's go!

53001
...!@Is that Ms. Noah?
It looks like her from here...@But is it really possible?
Let's catch up with her!

53002
...?
???
What's wrong, Master?
I-It's missing!@I had it just now too...
W-what should I do...?@I lost the charm Master gave me...
H-hold on, you look like you're about to cry...
Erina, the light!@Ribbon has a feeling that it might@have gone through that light!
The light... But why would it suddenly do thatï¼
It's just a feeling, but Ribbon thinks the charm@was drawn to something in there.@Come on, lets go look for it.
Okay...

53003
It's Master's Charm!@Wonderful... It's really here...
But the way back...@Guess the only way is forward...
That's okay, because we haven't seen Ms. Noah yet.@We can explore for a little longer.
Remember to hold on to that charm!
I will!@I really felt like crying back there...
And you pretty much did...

53004
Master... Wait...@We'll be going in circles@if we continue.
Really?@But Ms. Noah is nowhere in sight...
If Master wants to keep trying...@There was a downward path up ahead.@But how are we supposed to enter that cave...?

53005
...What's going on...@I was playing with Rumi and Irisu and then...
The Hall of Memory...@Could I be...

53006
...! It's Ms. Noah!@You didn't disappear after all!
Eh? You're...@Ehhh? Are you me?!@I can't believe it!
Wait wait wait...@Why am I dressed like that?!@That's so... so shameless!
What are you talking about Ms. Noah?@Haven't we met before?
Noah? No, I'm Erina.@And if I'm not mistaken...@Could you be... my physical self?
Erina?@But that's my name...
But you look different from any of my memories...@Are you my future self?
Because if I can see my physical self,@I'm probably an illusion in the@Hall of Memory right now...
Um...So you must be...@Noah's earlier memories?
A fairy... Are you her companion?
This Noah you're talking about,@I don't know her either.
I'm still getting that feeling@even though I know I'm an illusion...
The feeling that the only thing left for me...@is to disappear...@That kind of hurts...
Disappear?@But... we worked so hard to find you...@You can't just go away like that!
Illusions will definitely disappear.@That's how the Hall of Memory works...
But... You're not actually me, are you?@I don't think I'd forget how this hall works.
Erina was originally a bunny@so she can't be you!
Hmm... but if what Noah said was true...@It might be possible.
She's a bunny?@Could you explain?
Sure! I'm Master Rumi's pet bunny and Erina is@the name she gave me! But because of an incident@I got turned into a human...
So...Did Rumi really...?!@She actually adopted a bunny, and called it Erina!
So Rumi's still good old Rumi.@That's nice...

53008
So do you know Irisu? Is she doing okay?@She apparently has to see me every day@or else she gets really restless.@Is she still like that?
Ms. Irisu looks happy every day!@We've been together a lot recently too!
Is that because you're a bunny too?@I hope she didn't forget about me because of new bunnies...?
That said, if you're not me, then how's the@current me doing? Is everyone still trying@to play with my ears?
You mean Noah?
Ribbon... Wait!
...?
What's wrong?
......
Did something bad happen...?
......
Umm...
...I can tell that this will be bad news.@Its alright, I shouldn't bring too many bad memories@with me when I disappear...@Sometimes, that may even be a blessing...
My disappearance... it's about time.@That really gets me down...
This will be my last wish...@Before I disappear, could you grant me one last...@Unforgettable....
Unforgettable...?
Very few people manage to come down here,@and to be able to meet someone so like me...
If I can connect with someone like you,@that would make an outstanding memory...
Um... Could it be that you want to battle?@Wouldn't that be a problem for you?
Not at all! I'll fight at my best... I'm Erina,@the most magically powerful girl on this island!@I wont go easy on you!
...Magical Girl Erina?@Wait wait wait!@That doesn't mean you have to go all out!
Wah, No! H-how did you know?!@That's just a stupid name Cocoa made up!
Okay nevermind, time's running out!@Let's formally and happily connect with one another!

//Battle Success 1
53011
...Stop...@Ribbon can't take it anymore....
Me too...@Ms. Erina, I'm sorry butãwe're both exhausted...
...Are you really?
I'm actually pretty tired too...@One more hit and I might be the first to fall.
You're really powerful too! Just like I've heard!
...like you heard?

//Light appears
53012
...! This light is...
The memories materialized!@It really happened...
And they're determined to not disappear!@I want to share this with you.


53013
......
It's almost time for me to disappear...
Because you met the future me...@She left fragments of her precious@ memories with you..
And by connecting with you, I now have some of@those precious memories.@I understand now... I know what happened...
Ms. Erina...
So... the current me doesn't exist anymore?
That incident three years ago...@So much happened because of it...
What happened during that incident...?
......
Rabi Rabi Island was a very peaceful island.
Back then, the island was full of rabbits.@Everyone loved the rabbits until...
Until...?
The ancient barrier that protected the island@was broken. For some unknown external reason,@all the bunnies started to change and@became very violent.
I didn't want to but...@I tried to remove all the dangerous rabbits,@and rebuild the barrier.
But the magic barrier wasn't that easy to repair...@Part of the work needed to be done from the outside.@That means... someone had to be exiled...
The disappearance of the rabbits,@and my departure... I knew these would become@painful memories for everyone.
I'm still not sure if I made the right choice,@but I decided to wipe everyone's memories of@these events...
And you know the rest...@I got too lonely and became Noah...
......
I don't exist anymore, but this isn't your fault.@Don't beat youself up over it, Erina.
Besides, it's because of you that everyone can@still live here peacefully.
But hasn't the barrier been maintained for@a long time? That's what we heard.@If it's only been two or three years...
Perhaps... When everyone's memories were wiped,@their memories about the barrier had to be altered.
At the time, Pandora, Ashuri and Rita were the@strongest magic users after me.
We completed the stele, and used its magic@to protect Rabi Rabi Town.
And before I left, I asked them to@maintain the barrier.
They must have really cared about@Ms. Erina's request, for their memories@to change like that....
......
Erina, you're a good bunny...
If you're here,@Rabi Rabi Island will... definitely...

53014
She disappeared...
......
......
Erina... Don't be sad...@At least she left something important for us...
The Bunny's Memories...
It's another charm that I'll treasure!

53015
What...?!

53020
......
...Did something happen?@I was having lunch at home...
...Ms. Erinaï¼
Eh? You're...@Ehhh? Are you me?!@I can't believe it!
J-just a minute! What's with the deja vu?@We just met!
But if that's the case...
That's right! I was here just now!@I... I don't want to disappear again...

//Big Hug CG
53021
I don't know what happened, but I'm so happy@you're back!
Ah! Could it be...@Rumi's Charm!
That's the charm I gave Rumi...
Because you put the memories together@with the charm... I... I...
It's a miracle...This is great news!@Ms. Erina!
But illusions can't leave the cave...
Oh...
This is just a fairy's intuition,@But Ribbon has an idea...
...?

53022
Wow... It works!@If you merge the memories with the charm,@I can stay inside it!
Great, Ms. Erina!@Now you can come back to this world!
We should go and tell every...
No...@This is good enough...
I can just be here on the island with everyone.@It's already more than I can ask for...
If they remembered everything...@I'm sure I'll just bring back those sad memories.
But will you be okay with that?@Just living inside the charm?
Yes! I'll be fine!
But, since I've return to Rabi Rabi Island now,@I really want to look around again...
No problem! I know a lot of interesting places!@I'll take you around!
Wonderful, I can't wait!
If you need any help,@you can also call for me!


53500
Ah... I remember this place very clearly...
I used to picnic here with Irisu and Rumi.
Did you also carve those names?
Yeah!
Rumi said we should picnic here again.@Would you like to join us, Ms. Erina?
...I'll keep your memories a secret.
...Thanks.@I'll look forward to it!


53501
This is where I met Rita!@We practiced all sorts of magic here.
Because she's so hardworking, she really@understands people who try their best.


53502
The stele draws magic from here, and provides@basic protection for Rabi Rabi Town.@Is that right, Ms. Erina?
That's right, this was actually Ashuri's idea!@The theory was sound, but the side effects were@completely unexpected.
But her research is always dotted with@small misses like that!


53503
Pandora and I developed a mysterious creature@while we were down here. It was too unstable so@we stopped and discarded it.
Pandora didn't want more tourists in here and@she was probably worried it would be discovered.@But I forgot where we left it...


53504
We used to come down here to listen to Seana's songs...@Just getting lost in the music was relaxing...
Oh, have you heard of the Rabi-Ribi OST?


53505
Did you know?@Cocoa and I were the ones to complete the Carrot Bomb.
She probably forgot all about it...@So it's just been sitting here the whole time.


53506
Sky Island Town... I don't think I've been here.
I've heard that a succubus called Lilith lives@out here and that she has... great technique?@Would you be interested, Erina?
Ah... Just remembering her@is kind of embarrassing...


53507
So Aruraune used to stay here...@I never realized...
The more we explore, the more we gain!@There are always surprises to be discovered.@Don't you think so too?


53508
Um...

Are you searching for bunnies again?@Found anything yet?

1
Don't you think these bunny creatures are cute?@You need some protection to touch them though.

2
This Healing Stone can make sleeping unnecessary!@But using it also shortens your lifespan.@Not sure if that rumor is true...

3
This leads to unusual places!@The river where it's always twilight,@and the highlands where it's always night!

5
Someone is calling for help from the west@but nobody has seen anything.@Those giant things are too dangerous.

7
They say the Spectral Cave is under the forest,@but where's the entrance?

8
Apart from bombs, magic attacks work on some terrains.@The rock in the upper left is an example.

9
Remember, morning is preparation time!

10
There's...@There's nothing here at all.@Really.

11
There should be a path behind that rock.@How can it be destroyed?

12
Is this really a good idea?@None of you are here to play...@so why not give up on bunnies?

13
Rabi Rabi Town? Yes, this is the way.@Just follow the most obvious path.

14
Ahh... Can you contribute something already?@We're really quite poor.@Don't just look for bunnies...

15
I want to go home. I'm doing the same thing every day.

I hear there's a volcano thing under here.@One day it might explode...

23
There's a floating Island above this beach.@It's another Rabi Rabi specialty.

24
Life... I don't think it'll shorten life at all!@I haven't slept for a year thanks to this!

25
The rocks here don't look too solid.@I think there might be something under them...

26
Not many people today. It's you, isn't it?@Of course, there aren't many bunnies on the beach...

27
I heard about a bunny sighting...@Any progress?

28
This road goes to Rabi Rabi Ravine.@Everyone uses the Warp Stone though.@The slope is just too steep.

29
What? You aren't with them?@Take those things off your head then!@They will cause a misunderstanding!

30
Don't talk to me!@I'm on my break! Unlike you, I've got work to do!

31
Leaving so soon?@I hope you'll come back again to relax@and not to chase after bunnies...

32
The beach is this way! So's Rabi Rabi Town!

33
Everyone went into the pyramid.@I'm not going. It's too hot inside!

34
This pyramid suddenly appeared last week.@It's taking up a lot of space on the beach...

35
This is the most popular place!@but now there's only about half the people...

36
I found a hidden path nearby once...@but I can't find it anymore! Seriously, where is it?!

37
I thought you bunny lovers would stay away.@Are you here to look for bunnies?

38
People say it doesn't feel like a forest...@I find it quite nice, don't you agree?

39
We're pretty deep in the ravine.@I didn't expect anyone to make it here...

40
Go to Miriam's shop in Rabi Rabi Town.@There are things in there you won't find@anywhere else!
I'm not advertising!@It's a personal recommendation!

41
The warp stones are so convenient@that very few people come through here.@This is a waste of a perfectly good bridge.

42
Behave yourselves in town.@If you mess around again, you'll be banned.

43
Welcome to Rabi Rabi Town! Are you tourists?

44
This is Evernight Peak.@Many magic users come here at night.
Oh yes, most have joined the bunny catchers...@Oh, you're one of them too.

45
Darn, all my friends have joined!@Now I'm all alone...

46
This is the middle of the Pyramid.@There should be another way down.

47
Are you here to look for bunnies?@I don't think you'll find anything here...

48
Hey, do you know where the exit is?@I came here with my friend and we got lost.

49
Hmm, I'm lost.@Have you seen my friend?

50
You were curious about the pyramid, right?@There are strange beams ahead.@Don't touch them! They almost killed me!

51
Oh, new explorers?@We've already mapped the nearby levels.@The door ahead leads to the Warp Stone.

52
Yikes... How did you get here?!@Don't tell them I'm slacking off in here!

53
There's a Warp Stone up ahead!@That means you can come back anytime!

54
Bunny hunters are showing up as well.
Wait, you're one of them too!@You guys really are everywhere!

55
The library isn't open yet. Come back later?

58
You people came all the way here?@Remember to keep your voice down in the library.

59
This is still the library, even if it's just the entrance.@Please stop jumping like that!

60
I hear a clock but I can't see one.@Are they too lazy to draw one?

61
Did you know? This island isn't part of Rabi Rabi.@It floated in from elsewhere.

62
Welcome to Sky Island Town!@Are you looking for someone?

63
Are you from Rabi Rabi?@I thought there weren't any rabbits here!

64
You're from down below?@I didn't think people from Rabi Rabi came here...

65
Did you know? This island used to float freely@in the sky, but one day, it suddenly stood still.@It's anchored here because people thought it would@fall from the sky.

66
Um, you don't look like you know the place,@so let me tell you something useful.@If you go up here, you might meet@a troublesome succubus.

67
Because we have the Warp Stone,@coming here isn't that much of a hassle.

68
This is the back of the library.@The entrance is sealed because it's understaffed.

69
I-Is the succubus gonna show up?@I actually want to give it a try.

70
Just ignore her, she has weird interests.

71
If you walk this way, you'll reach the end of the island.@Don't fall off!

72
This island has recently been a target for that succubus.@It must be because all the girls here are cute!

73
On that day, I left town to take a look,@but I saw a bunch of bunny-eared girls@running around the graveyard!@Is everyone in Rabi Rabi like that?

74
Um... I'm not from here.@I'm just here for the succubus.

75
Ever heard of Meow Meow Island?@It's a little bit to the west of here.@This island is also from around there.

76
My friend was taken by the succubus.@I hope she isn't all weird when she comes back...

99
Hmm... where is the Meaty Bone going?

100
Hehehe...

101
You get extra credit for finding the production team's@secret base!
As a reward, let me tell you a secret!@Bunnies can do a reverse wall jump after@changing their direction in midair!

111
Rabi-Ribi forever! @Bunny ears forever!
Before I fly away, I want to tell you a secret!@If you turn the Rabi-Ribi Logo 90 degrees@counter-clockwise, you'll see 2 rabbits!@I designed that!
What? They don't look like rabbits?@Uh, here's something more substantial.@Soundtest can only be unlocked above hard, and@at the highest difficulty, some CGs will look different!

121
Sup.@Ever heard of a mobile game called Oral Buster?

131
H-Hold on! I wasn't the one who set the difficulty!
Also, did you know? After using the reverse wall jump,@try hitting the wall with a Quick Drop.@You'll jump higher!

141
No, no, no! Not the left! @The production team are in the room to the right!

151
CreSpirit Forever!

161
I-Intruder!

171
Don't cut off my DLC project!

181
Aww, yeah! I'm done. I'm getting off work.

191
......

201
A cute l-loli fairy!

211
Ssshh... Don't tell the others.@I brought the cat to the studio!

212
Which Rabi would you Ribi?

300
Hey, Hi! Congratulations for getting here!
Umm... How do you feel about the difficulty?@If you're having a tough time, I can help you out!
Don't worry! I'm 100% legit!@So do you want to lower the difficulty level?

301
...And done! Have fun and take it easy!@Remember, this cannot be reversed!@So you might want to choose a different save slot!

302
A-are you sure? Wait!@You're already playing Casual!

303
Fantastic, so you're really looking for a challenge!@Well, if you need me, I'll always be here!

304
This is the Halloween area and it's going to be tough!@If you're still working on the main story, please turn back!@By: Skullo
